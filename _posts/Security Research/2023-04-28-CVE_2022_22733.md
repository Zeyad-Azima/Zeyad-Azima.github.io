# **Introduction**

A vulnerability discovered in Apache ShardingSphere ElasticJob-UI known as `CVE-2022-22733`, The vulnerability lead to exposure of sensitive informatiopns and as a results it allows an attacker who has guest account to do privilege escalation.

# **Testing Lab**

For the testing lab the vulnerability affecting version 3.0.0 and prior versions. So, we can use docker to build our testing lab, First pull the docker image:

```
sudo docker pull apache/shardingsphere-elasticjob-lite-ui:3.0.0
```

Now, Let's run the app:

```
sudo docker run -d --name elasticjob-ui -p 8088:8088 -e ELASTIC_JOB_GUEST_ENABLED=true apache/shardingsphere-elasticjob-lite-ui:3.0.0
```

Here it will run the app and enable the guest access, Therefore we can simulate and reproduce the vulnerability.

# **What is ShardingSphere ElasticJob-UI ?**

ShardingSphere ElasticJob-UI is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that is part of the ShardingSphere ElasticJob project and provides an easy-to-use interface to manage, monitor, and visualize the status of jobs running in a ShardingSphere ElasticJob cluster. It simplifies the management and administration of distributed scheduling tasks, making it more convenient for users to manage their jobs without dealing directly with the underlying API or configuration files.

# **Static Analysis**

Let's Open burpsuite and take a look at the login request and response.

![](/assets/images/a3c77f68ab6940726d7fb61cc9b00ef3)

In the above screenshot when we login, It provide us back with a response contains the `accessToken`. If we copy the `accessToken` value and decode it:

![](/assets/images/4059668d5c71d349e3a6d2980def19bd)

As we can see after decoding the value, It's exposed the `guest` username and password which is the user we logged-in with & Also exposed the `root` username and password, As a results we can use the exposed `root` creds and escalate our privileges. Let's see the root cause of this issue by analyzing and going through the login/authentication process code. Now, Under the following class `org.apache.shardingsphere.elasticjob.lite.ui.security.AuthenticationFilter` we can see the following:

![](/assets/images/77cac8700b632826138caa3c4711a1d5)

Which obvuise is the endpoint where the authentication process happens, Let's dig deeper into the class code:

![](/assets/images/5f77f486a2077b0edabdd341892c158c)

First, It's defining the package and import needed libraries by scrolling down we can see the start of defining the class:

![](/assets/images/9007545f86a4c57cf24fb4ebb2178d35)

This `AuthenticationFilter` class implements the `Filter` interface and has a constant `LOGIN_URI` that represents the `URI` for the login endpoint, a `Gson` object for `JSON` serialization and deserialization, and a `UserAuthenticationService` object from the `UserAuthenticationService` class that can be set using a setter method. If we go to that class under the same location we will be able to see that it's responsiable to check for the user in the authentication process. In other words, It's a main part of the authentication. As we mentioned before about the `Filter` interface, It's basically a part of the `Servlet API` and is used to define filters that can intercept requests and responses going to and coming from a web application, For example, modifying request parameters, add or modify request headers, perform logging, and even transform the response returned by the server. Something important we have to know about the `Filter` interface and It's that the `Filter` interface contains three methods:

- `init(FilterConfig config)`: This method is called when the filter is initialized and It allows the filter to perform any initialization that is required.
    
- `doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)`: This method is called for every incoming request that matches the filter mapping and It allows the filter to examine or modify the request, perform any filtering logic, and then pass the request on to the next filter in the chain or to the servlet.
    
- `destroy()`: This method is called when the filter is destroyed and It allows the filter to perform any cleanup that is required.  
    By completing our lines of codes we can see the `doFilter()` method:
    

![](/assets/images/9ef9e688b010ae213464c669e6a50487)

The method takes three parameters `servletRequest`, `servletResponse` and `filterChain`, `servletRequest` and `servletResponse` parameters are instances of the `ServletRequest` and `ServletResponse` interfaces, respectively. The `filterChain` parameter is an object that represents the next filter in the chain or the servlet that the request is being sent to. Then, The method first casts the `ServletRequest` and `ServletResponse` objects to `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse`, respectively. After that it checks if the request `URI` matches the `LOGIN_URI` constant. If it does, the `handleLogin` method is called to handle the login request and If not the method checks if the request has a valid access token by checking the value of the `Access-Token` header. If the access token is valid, the request is passed on to the next filter in the chain using the `doFilter` method of the `FilterChain` object. Otherwise, the `respondWithUnauthorized` method is called to return an unauthorized status code to the client.

![](/assets/images/000b77ffd459e65870b81fa9d62d5741)

The `destroy()` method is empty and is used to clean up any resources used by the filter and `handleLogin` method is responsible for handling user login requests. It receives a `HttpServletRequest` object, which contains the user's credentials, and a `HttpServletResponse` object, which is used to return the server's response.It's first reads the user's credentials from the request using the `getReader` method and converts them to a `UserAccount` object using the `gson.fromJson` method. Then calls the `checkUser` method of the `userAuthenticationService` object to check the validity of the user's credentials. If the credentials are valid the method creates a `HashMap` object to hold the user's information, including their username, accessToken, and whether they are a guest user. It then writes this information to the response using the `httpResponse.getWriter().write` method after converting it to a `JSON` string using the `gson.toJson` method. If the user's credentials are invalid, the method calls the `respondWithUnauthorized` method, which writes a `JSON` string to the response indicating that the user is unauthorized.

In this line we can notice it's where the `accessToken` returned to the user and it's being called from the `getToken()` method from `userAuthenticationService` object which is the `userAuthenticationService` class. Now, If we go to the class:

```
package org.apache.shardingsphere.elasticjob.lite.ui.security;

import com.google.common.base.Strings;
import com.google.gson.Gson;
import lombok.Setter;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

/**
 * User authentication service.
 */
@Component
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "auth")
@Setter
public final class UserAuthenticationService {
    
    private String rootUsername;
    
    private String rootPassword;
    
    private String guestUsername;
    
    private String guestPassword;
    
    private final Base64 base64 = new Base64();
    
    private Gson gson = new Gson();
    
    /**
     * Check user.
     *
     * @param userAccount user account
     * @return check success or failure
     */
```

We can see that it starts with defining the package, class and some variables which we can see in the `accessToken` when we decoded it such as `rootUsername`, `rootPassword`, `guestUsername` & `guestPassword` and creates a new `Base64` object along with `JSON` object to store data into.

```
    public AuthenticationResult checkUser(final UserAccount userAccount) {
        if (null == userAccount || Strings.isNullOrEmpty(userAccount.getUsername()) || Strings.isNullOrEmpty(userAccount.getPassword())) {
            return new AuthenticationResult(null, null, false, false);
        }
        if (rootUsername.equals(userAccount.getUsername()) && rootPassword.equals(userAccount.getPassword())) {
            return new AuthenticationResult(rootUsername, rootPassword, true, false);
        }
        if (guestUsername.equals(userAccount.getUsername()) && guestPassword.equals(userAccount.getPassword())) {
            return new AuthenticationResult(guestUsername, guestPassword, true, true);
        }
        return new AuthenticationResult(null ,null, false, false);
    }
     /**
     * Get user authentication token.
     *
     * @return authentication token
     */
    public String getToken() {
        return base64.encodeToString(gson.toJson(this).getBytes());
    }
}
```

After that It provides a method to check user authentication by comparing the provided username and password with the pre-configured root and guest usernames and passwords. Finally, We can see the `getToken()` method that encodes the current `UserAuthenticationService` object as a `Base64` encoded string which is returned as the authentication token (`accessToken`) and here comes the vulnerability with the `getToken()` method is returning the `Base64` string with representation of the entire `UserAuthenticationService` object including the root username and password. As a results it's exposed as we saw in the first of the analysis.

# **Dynamic Analysis**

Now, Let's Setup our lab in debugging mode to see how it works dynamically. As we pulled the image before we will just run it again with a different name and port.

```
sudo docker run -d --name elasticjob-ui-debug -p 8888:8088 -p 8000:8000 -e ELASTIC_JOB_GUEST_ENABLED=true -e JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n" apache/shardingsphere-elasticjob-lite-ui:3.0.0
```

Here we added a new port mapping which is `8000` for debugging and also added new environment variable to set debugging options `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n"` & Finally, a port mapping for the web interface of the application `8888` to `8088`. Now, It's time to setup our debugger through `IntelliJ` IDE, We need to download the `ShardingSphere` version `3.0.0` source code from `github` and open it as a new project inside `IntelliJ` IDE.

![](/assets/images/7e13324ba73ecf47d39c4a5f01548f73)

After that go to `Run` Tab and then click on `Edit Configurations`:

![](/assets/images/3563640afdd0e1fbdd8907de86946d1f)

Then Click on the `+` add sign and choose `Remote JVM Debug`:

![](/assets/images/1f0d7c3b222a7cdf4f888dbda905f7c9)

And Name it as you want & configure the remote debugger, By adding the machine docker `IP`, Debugging port which is `8000` and the module to debug which is the `ShardingSphere-ElasticJob-lite-UI`:

![](/assets/images/d86a406b4e3fe943abac1c22debf5457)

Finally, Let's set our breakpoint on the `handlelogin` function under the `org.apache.shardingsphere.elasticjob.lite.ui.security.AuthenticationFilter` class:

![](/assets/images/916c67c993120a8d86663ddfa5696c06)

Now, Press on the `debug` button:

![](/assets/images/a3cf38fc15ab5fdfb875c7bbff7b4422)

We can see it's telling us that's connected successfully to the targeted VM debug:

![](/assets/images/913cd6fde00551ad59a0550abe2b753b)

Let's visit the application on our browser and login. Once we hit the `Login` button, We will be able to see that it's hit the breakpoint and our debugger is working:

![](/assets/images/ea5ccb61520a1ebf6c1e6daff87e1c3c)

Here under `this` in the debugger which refers within the `AuthenticationFilter` class that it has the `UserAuthenticationService` Object which is made out of the `UserAuthenticationService` class itself:

![](/assets/images/1e51bd8bc7d6eec2d4e2e16ba8220ded)

We can see that it's already carry the `guest` & `root` names and passwords, Along with the created Objects of `Base64` and `Gson`. Now, Let's step over and set a breakpoint to line where `accessToken` get added to the request:

![](/assets/images/3ab1f16b07b71892be55f4deaed0e679)

In the above screenshot as we see, By stepping over until we arrive to `checkUser()` function which is taking the credentials entered by user.

![](/assets/images/250ce77c60110bb7fc050d81609a8007)

By stepping over 2 more steps we can see that the `authenticationResult` started to created & Mentioned under it the `username`,`password` which are our credentials, `success` which is the authentication status and in this situation it's `true` as credentials matched & Finally, `isGuest` which indicates if the user is a `guest` or no and in our case yes it's.

![](/assets/images/89b326f135d1a55bac8c568b9fd37aaf)

here we can see the `result` which is a `HashMap` and will be sent with the response body. Clearly it's generated the token and if we take this value & decode it we will be able to see the exposure of the `root` username and password, along with the `guest` username and password that loaded at first of the debugging in a refer with the `UserAuthenticationService` class object. If we do the same with the `root` account we obtained from the token which is `root`:`root` & see how it will be remain the same and will return the both users accounts in the token as we can see in the below screenshot:

![](/assets/images/ee22d05822057eb444ffec3fd8b7b123)

# **Patch Diffing**

Now, Coming to the patches that applied on the code, It's a lot of modifications but, we will focus on the modifications made for the classes.

### UserAuthenticationService.java

![](/assets/images/f937e90e006c85f26976e4d90b38c8bd)

  
The vulnerability in the original code block is that the `getToken()` method of the `UserAuthenticationService` class returns a token that contains the root username and password in plaintext which used in the `doFilter()` method to authenticate the user, which allows an attacker to extract the root username and password by intercepting and decoding the token and the patched code block fixes the vulnerability by changing the `getToken()` method to `isValidToken()` and `getToken()` methods which check if the token is valid and return a new token that does not contain the root username and password. Additionally, the `handleLogin()` method in the patched code block now checks if the user is authenticated using a valid token instead of using the vulnerable `getToken()` method. If the token is valid, the `filterChain.doFilter()` method is called to allow the user to access the requested resource. Otherwise, the `respondWithUnauthorized()` method is called to deny access to the user.

### UserAuthenticationFilter.java

![](/assets/images/441c1fb480bec8a81f61a1b7717f4f87)

The changes made to the `AuthenticationFilter` class prevent the vulnerability by implementing token based authentication instead of using a hardcoded username and password. Specifically, Adding the ability to generate a token based on a user's credentials using the `getToken()` method in the `UserAuthenticationService` class. This token is generated using the `com.auth0.jwt` library and is signed using a randomly generated `HMAC256` algorithm and `isValidToken()` method to the `UserAuthenticationService` class to check if the provided token is valid or not, Also Modified the `handleLogin` and `doFilter` methods. Additionally, the `AuthenticationFilter` class is modified to use the `ObjectMapper` instead of `Gson` for `JSON` serialization and deserialization. In the `handleLogin()` method the `gson.fromJson()` call is replaced with `objectMapper.readValue()` to deserialize the `UserAccount` object. Finally, in the `doFilter()` method, the if statement that checks for the access token is modified to use the `isValidToken()` method instead of checking for equality with the token obtained from `userAuthenticationService.getToken()`.

# **Conclusion**

![](/assets/images/dba3c2e2ae5646706285e61a610166a4)

At the end, We saw how the vulnerability occured and why, By showing the wrong implementation of authentication process and showed how it's fixed in the patch applied to the code by using the `JWT` Library to generate the token with a secret key to which keeps the confidntiality of the data. As a results it's not exposing the credentials anymore.
