# Introduction
I discoverd a bug while playing around with the `ZXHN H168N V3.5` home router device which result in killing the router and make it go down with one request. So, If you want to get the device alive again, You have to restart it or wait for hours. Let's go and explain it.

# Spotting the Bug
I was doing the test as a blackbox without looking into hte firmware (`We will look at the firmware later`). First go to your device dashboard and login. Then, go to `Local network` tab. After that move to `WLAN`. Finally for sure don't forget your `Burp Suite` tool, Since we doing the test on the web `Application` interface level. So, we be able to intercept the requests and play around with it. As the following step showed in the bellow picture: open any of the `WLAN` SSID and click on save.

But, before this open burp suite to intercept the request.

Now, i will send the request to the repeater to explain the vulnerability, by press right click and choose send to repeater :

Let's go to the repeater tab and play with the request, You will see the request then click go: 

![ae7681e55df866022f9c39684b9f2ba1.png](/assets/images/ae7681e55df866022f9c39684b9f2ba1.png)

So, Let's explain what actual happened and what the request doing and what is the response for it. The request is about modifying the `WLAN` settings and You can see in the response tab, In the body you can see the `XML` response from server and has many objects, as example the `<INSTIDENTITY>` you will see that this object has a value "DEV.WIFI.AP1.PSK1", it looks like a value refering to `WIFI Access point 1`, Casue as you saw before we had 2 Access points in the router.

Now, we have `XML` response in this web application, We will try `XXE` (iNJECTING SOME `xml` body to check for it). I even take the response and send it back as a request.

When, I did that it's actually back to me with more information about the `Parameters` and each `value` for each `Paramenter` as you can see in the below screenshot.

![66a084657c8674b24e1eb0aae7e929f6.png](/assets/images/66a084657c8674b24e1eb0aae7e929f6.png)

I tried other payloads related to `XXE` ,. But, non of payloads worked. So, This bug is limited. Now, this bug is authenticated, When we are not authenticated it will not show any information. But, it will parse our request without any problems.

# Under The Hood
Now, We will take a static look at the backend code to understand more. So, what we need now is the `Firmware` for the device and we have many ways to do it:

- You can search for the firmware on the official website for the vendor.
- Download it from any other source (`after someone already dump it from the device and published it`).
- Dump the firmware through URAT, You could read a detailed blog from [Here](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/accessing-and-dumping-firmware-through-uart).
- Finally dumping the firmware using `CH341A` Mini programmer USB, You could read a detailed blog from [Here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/dumping-firmware-with-the-ch341a-programmer/).

In my case, I found that someone dump it before, Therefor, i download it. Now, Let's extract the firmware using `Binwalk` tool and discover the firmware files. Specially the vulnerable end-point file.

- Extracting the firmware: `binwalk -e firmware`. The `-e` is for extracting.

![78865c8856f609e7460ac352774c1489.png](/assets/images/78865c8856f609e7460ac352774c1489.png)

In the above screenshot it's done successfully and we extracted the firmware as we can see in the following picature, we moved to the firmware extracted directory:

![44e9e045b9e92d1bbcc6b567268da615.png](/assets/images/44e9e045b9e92d1bbcc6b567268da615.png)

Now, if we go to the `/squashfs-root` directory, We can see the directory to all the `Linux` system directories which the firmware `router system` built-on. Under the `/home` directory we will find the `/httpd` directory which home directory for the `web service` user that hosting the web-interface for the router. (`You can see on the following picature`)

![10ad50bd5bf05eb2a2d9c4d91f5ed74b.png](/assets/images/10ad50bd5bf05eb2a2d9c4d91f5ed74b.png)

Now, backing to the `URL` of the end-point we were testing, `/common_page/Localnet_WlanBasicAd_WLANSSIDConf_EncryOption_lua.lua`. It's clearly the interface written in `Lua` programming language. Let's move on to our vulnerable page under `/common_page` directory. If we list the files in the directory and grep the first words from the page name we can see the following:

![b30e069bf0cf0840e42006ac034fefc4.png](/assets/images/b30e069bf0cf0840e42006ac034fefc4.png)

We can see that the page full name is not here (`It may be a one old step realse from the actual one we do have`). So, I will pick up the `Localnet_WlanBasicAd_WLANSSIDConf_lua.lua` which is the closer one to our page and if we checked the file using `file` command, We will be able to see that it's a `Lua, ByteCode, Version 5.1`:

![6fe68045bc360a9fff5e84a20955150d.png](/assets/images/6fe68045bc360a9fff5e84a20955150d.png)

If we tried to read the file using `cat` command, the output will be non-understandable representation:

![1603808fcdeb7b7147e208b94db94127.png](/assets/images/1603808fcdeb7b7147e208b94db94127.png)

## 	Lua ByteCode
As we saw before the file is Lua ByteCode. After a couple hours of search, I was able to find this [website](https://lua-bytecode.github.io/) to decompile `Lua ByteCode`. Therefor, we will be able to analysis and understand what happen in the background.

![904103d6576d3b81cbfadbf1613ff69d.png](/assets/images/904103d6576d3b81cbfadbf1613ff69d.png)

We can see that we have a lot of code here and if we scroll down you gonna see some instructions looks like `Assembly`, After searching for the `Lua Bytecode`. I found the follwoing [reference](https://the-ravi-programming-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lua_bytecode_reference.html#instruction-summary) with the instructions and description for each instruction:

![507c511477c04c9c90c1d451167b5e4d.png](/assets/images/507c511477c04c9c90c1d451167b5e4d.png)

So, Now we can start to read and understand. If we take a look at the first few lines it's giving us information about the language version, etc. But, the starting part where we can see the main function and it's information:

```
************ Main Function
Source: @/home/xialei/Builds/H168NV31_Develop_BaseCSP3005P01/chip_mtk7510/product/H168NV31_BELT/scripts/../basefilesystem/luapages/html//common_page/Localnet_WlanBasicAd_WLANSSIDConf_lua.lua
Parameters: 0
Is vararg: yes
Local variable 'arg': absent
VM registers needed: 36
```

- `Source`: The source code file directory (`Which also seems from the firmware team developers under /home`).
- `Parameters`: Number of functions parameters.
- `Is Vrarg`: Meaning it can accept a variable number of arguments.
- `Local variable 'arg': absent`:is a special variable in Lua that refers to a list of arguments passed to a function.
- `VM registers needed: 36`: Requirted VM Registers to execute.]

Under the main functions we can find 2 things `Constants` which are variables and can not be changed, Also `Locals` which are defined local variables.

  ```

As you can see we have 3 fields:
- `Const#<number>`: the Constant variable number.
- `<Type>`: The variable data type (e.x:`Float,stringm etc`).
- `<Name>`: The variable name.
 
Now, to the `Locals` variables:
- Locals
```
Locals: 29
  Local#1   R0   def:<4>    scope:<5..349>      name: InstXML
  Local#2   R1   def:<5>    scope:<6..349>      name: ErrorXML

  Local#17  R16  def:<60>   scope:<61..349>     name: WLANBasicIDTable
  Local#18  R17  def:<68>   scope:<69..349>     name: FP_ACTION
  Local#19  R18  def:<71>   scope:<72..349>     name: _WEPCONIG
  Local#20  R19  def:<74>   scope:<75..349>     name: _PSKCONIG
  Local#21  R20  def:<77>   scope:<78..349>     name: FP_IDENTITY
  Local#22  R21  def:<80>   scope:<81..349>     name: WEP_IDENTITY0
  Local#23  R22  def:<83>   scope:<84..349>     name: WEP_IDENTITY1
  Local#24  R23  def:<86>   scope:<87..349>     name: WEP_IDENTITY2
  Local#25  R24  def:<89>   scope:<90..349>     name: WEP_IDENTITY3

  Local#29  R28  def:<99>   scope:<100..349>    name: WEP_PARA_FILTER
```

Here we can see that there are 5 fields:

- `Local#<number>`: The Local variable number.
- `R<number>`: The register that the variable assigned to.
- `def:<number>`: Line that the variable defined on, In the code.
- `scope:<ramge>`: indicates that the variable is in scope (can be accessed and modified) from a range of lines in the code.
- `<Name>`: Finally the variable name.

If we take a look at the `Constants` & `Local` variable names including the same parameters in our request.:
```
IF_ACTION | Const#33  string    "IF_ACTION"
Enable | Const#21  string    "Enable"
_InstID | Const#36  string    "_InstID"
_PSKCONIG | Local#20  R19  def:<74>   scope:<75..349>     name: _PSKCONIG
BeaconType | Const#14  string    "BeaconType"
WPAAuthMode | Const#17  string    "WPAAuthMode"
11iAuthMode | Const#19  string    "11iAuthMode"
WPAEncryptType | Const#18  string    "WPAEncryptType"
11iEncryptType | Const#20  string    "11iEncryptType"
_InstID_PSK | Const#41  string    "_InstID_PSK"
ESSID | Const#13  string    "ESSID"
ESSIDHideEnable | Const#23  string    "ESSIDHideEnable"
KeyPassphrase | Const#30  string    "KeyPassphrase"

and many more parameters......
```

- `Note`: you could find differents in files becuase of the firmware `version & realse`

Also there are some cariables has the `XML` name in as the following which explains the `XML` format type:
```
  Local#1   R0   def:<4>    scope:<5..349>      name: InstXML
  Local#2   R1   def:<5>    scope:<6..349>      name: ErrorXML
  Local#3   R2   def:<6>    scope:<7..349>      name: OutXML
  Local#6   R5   def:<10>   scope:<11..349>     name: xmlStr
  Local#27  R26  def:<93>   scope:<94..349>     name: xmlTable
```

Now, backing to the request again as the `_InstID` is a `Const` variable. It has a value in the request as we can see, But when we try to change the value. It's giving us error:
- Before changing the value

- After Changing the value, It's giving an error.

- Here Trying to flow it with huge value to get any crash, andIt didn't work.

# Final Thoughts
As we didn't do any dynamic analysis. Cause it will require us to emulate the firmware and debug it,To make everything clear. But, there are a logical posability that the bug in the following line:
```
GETTABLE 20 20 -36     <77>   R20@FP_IDENTITY = R20["_InstID"]
```

Let's explain the line first the  `GETTABLE` operation is used to retrieve a value from a table which in this case is the `XMLtable` and it will retrive the value stored in the key `_InstID` and store it into `FP_IDENTITY` that holded at `R20`. In this case, As we pass a huge value it will crash the Lua VM which running the app.

# Conclusion
We can not fully admit that the `Final Thoughts` we discuss is the right or final one as we didn't dig deep into and perform dynamic analysis. But, we would be analyzing it dynamically to fully verify the `Final Thoughts`. Also, it could be the same way but in another place or line of code.
