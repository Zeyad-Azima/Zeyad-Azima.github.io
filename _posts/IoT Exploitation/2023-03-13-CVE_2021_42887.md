# **Introduction**

A vulnerability discovered in TOTOLINK `EX1200T` model known as `CVE-2021-42887` which lead to authentication bypass, as a results anyone exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific request through `formLoginAuth.htm` page will be able to access the device without a need to login then control the device. Note:(`Everything you obtain here is for educational purposes, Don't use or abuse any bug against any target without permissions`)

# **Obtaining the Firmware**

Before we start we would need the firmware of the device, Therefore We can take a static look at the code and how it works to understand more. So, what we need is the vulnerable Firmware for the device which is `V4.1.2cu.5215` and we have many ways to do it:

- You can search for the firmware on the official website for the vendor.
    
- Download it from any other source (after someone already dump it from the device and published it).
    
- Dump the firmware through `UART`, You could read a detailed blog from [Here](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/accessing-and-dumping-firmware-through-uart).
    
- Also, you could contact the support to provide you with the firmware.
    
- Finally dumping the firmware using `CH341A` Mini programmer USB, You could read a detailed blog from [Here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/dumping-firmware-with-the-ch341a-programmer/).
    

In my case, I found the firmware on the vendor website. Now, Let's extract the firmware using `binwalk` tool as the following `binwalk -e --run-as=root "TOTOLINK_C8180E-1C_EX1200T_WX022_8197F_SPI_8M64M_V4.1.2cu.5215_B20210330_ALL.web"` and here is the output:

```
$ ls
TOTOLINK_C8180E-1C_EX1200T_WX022_8197F_SPI_8M64M_V4.1.2cu.5215_B20210330_ALL.web
$ sudo binwalk -e --run-as=root "TOTOLINK_C8180E-1C_EX1200T_WX022_8197F_SPI_8M64M_V4.1.2cu.5215_B20210330_ALL.web"

And as i am using `Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)`, Here we can browser our firmware normally:

# **The Analysis**

It's the time for the analysis. We will need `Burp Suite` to see how is the request of the authentication looks like on the device before it's go to the device web server.

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/3e7837b95070275b4c73f2607eadc00a)

  
As we can see in the above screenshot from `Burp Suite`, We can notice that the web app made out of `Aasp.net` and the `formLoginAuth.htm` is requested, If we go to it and take a look at the request which is as the following:

```
GET /formLoginAuth.htm?authCode=1&userName=admin&password=admin&goURL=home.asp&action=login HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.254
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0

Referer: http://192.168.0.254/login.asp
DNT: 1

```

We can guess that this `html` page take the parameters as the following: `authCode`, `userName`, `password`, `goURL` & `action`. And then pass it to one of the `ASP` endpoints. So, Let's go to the firmware we extracted and check the `formLoginAuth.htm`. Before that we can see also the `login.asp`, But if we go to it the request and the following:

```
GET /login.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.254
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0

If-Modified-Since: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:03 GMT
If-None-Match: "-1518032379"
```

And if you take a look at the `URL` it just for the login page you see. Let's move forward with `formLoginAuth.htm`. By going to the `\squashfs-root\web_cste` directory we can find our web app files:

![](/assets/images/399c1fd22523740eb10abf5fe94556c3)

&nbsp;

As you can see we can't find `formLoginAuth.htm` you may think this page only get generated on the login process at the Runtime. Unforently, I checked it by accessing the device through `telnet` and it's not get created. But, we have our `login.asp` page let's take a look on this page. While going through the code ypu can notice that the login request is sent to `cstecgi.cgi` page in the `cgi-bin` directory:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/images/e4b83b2f774f214648024efc3b0a6d59)

&nbsp;

And by going back to `Burp Suite` again, You can find the following requests made to the page:

![](/assets/images/5cbe01347552bf8df81a5e2d4f7adbc7)

&nbsp;

We can see the login request obvious and by checking it out we can confirm it's where the login request get process through it:

```
POST /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi?action=login HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.254
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

username=admin&password=admin
```

Now, By going to the file and check it with the `file` command, We can see it's an `ELF 32bit MIPS` file:

![](/assets/images/48ec7cb2668c9472fae20b66fa4affb7)

It's the time to do some reverse using `Ghidra`, Open it and create a new project i named it `EX1200T` for the device name and drop the `cstecgi.cgi` file into the project:

![](/assets/images/b7f5c6d18e0c265298daa5ac8012a16e)

After that open the file using `Code Browser` within `Ghidra`:

![](/assets/images/8206f1f35ff6a9d40f86cfa58e33391a)

Then, analysis the file:

![](/assets/images/da1ddc7f23209d071f51cb391f97dc9d)

Navigating to `Symbol Tree` and let's check out the functions:

![](/assets/images/e15843ce83bfae14416e1ee5cc31647c)

After going through the functions clearly inside `FUN_00400dd8` function we can see the following lines of codes. But, there is no thing interesting and it's all about functions calling other functions:

![](/assets/images/678cb507c6cc5b22ae2c4511edd3e469)

We just can see that `httpStatus`, `redirectURL` & `responseParam` being passed to some unclear functions. But, After a long time of searching you can see under `\squashfs-root\lib\cste_modules` folder that there are libraries named as the following:

```
app.so
cloudupdate.so
global.so
lan.so
product.so
system.so
upgrade.so
wireless.so
wps.so
```

After reversing this libraries you will know that it's clearly used by the `cstecgi.cgi` to perform different operations and changes through the device panel. Let's identify which one perform the login process by searching through the following `Bash` one liner using `strings` command:

```
for i in $(ls -la | awk '{print $9}' | grep ".so"); do echo ""; echo "Lib Name: $i"; strings $i | grep "login"; done
```

The above line will print the library name after this will run the `strings` command on the library to get any string has the work `login` and will print the results under the library name. Therefore, we will be able to know which library contains the `login` process or anything related. Command output:

```
Lib Name: app.so

Lib Name: cloudupdate.so

Lib Name: global.so
loginAuth
loginflag
loginAuth
loginAuthUrl
mobile/login.asp
login.asp
,"redirectURL":"http://%s/formLoginAuth.htm?authCode=%d&userName=%s&password=%s&goURL=%s&action=login&flag=1"}
,"redirectURL":"http://%s/formLoginAuth.htm?authCode=%d&userName=%s&password=%s&goURL=%s&action=login"}
loginpass
loginFlag
loginIp

Lib Name: lan.so

Lib Name: product.so

Lib Name: system.so

Lib Name: upgrade.so

Lib Name: wireless.so

Lib Name: wps.so
```

And as we can see it's with-in the `global.so` library, As we did with the `cstecgi.cgi` file. Let's do the same with the library with `Ghidra`. After opening the `Functions` tab under `Symbol Tree` we can notice the `loginAuth` function:

![](/assets/images/2316070fb027146d1fc119a3451a0e3b)

So, the flaw of the login process is as the following:

![](/assets/images/c8c2b74880a30421bff4365182521cb2)

Now, Let's navigate to the function and understand what this function do and how it works. First the function start by taking 3 parameters

```
void loginAuth(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2,undefined4 param_3)
```

Which are `param_1`, `param_2` and `param_3`. By going through the rest of the code you gonna see that mostly are declaring of variables, Until we reach the line number `73`:

![](/assets/images/3d9279131f711b45a1e1293da25ecb59)

We can see here it's created 3 variables:

- `uVar1`: In this variable it's assigning a value of calling a function called `websGetVar()` and passing `param_2`, `LoginAuthUrl` which it could be the `HTML` page and an empty string at the end. (`We will back to this function used again`)
    
- `uVar2` : Here it's assigning this variable to store json objects.
    
- `iVar5`: Here it's assigning `0`.  
    after that we can see a while loop and inside the loop we can see the following:
    

```
  while( true ) {
    iVar8 = iVar5 + 1;
    iVar5 = getNthValueSafe(iVar5,uVar1,0x26,auStack_1718,0x400);
    if (iVar5 == -1) break;
    iVar3 = getNthValueSafe(0,auStack_1718,0x3d,auStack_1318,0x80);
    iVar5 = iVar8;
    if ((iVar3 != -1) &&
       (iVar8 = getNthValueSafe(1,auStack_1718,0x3d,auStack_1298,0x100), iVar8 != -1)) {
      uVar4 = cJSON_CreateString(auStack_1298);
      cJSON_AddItemToObject(uVar2,auStack_1318,uVar4);
    }
  }
```

In this loop it's adding `1` to `iVar5` which is `0` above and after that assign the result to `iVar8` variable. After that calling a function `getNthValueSafe()` and passing unknown parameters to it after that assign the result to `iVar5`. Then, there is an `if` condition checks for the value of `iVar5` if it's equal to `-1` it will break the loop and if this condition didn't executed it do the same before the condition with the `iVar5` and `getNthValueSafe()` function but with different parameters and assign it to `iVar3`. Then, It will get back the value of `iVar5` by assigning the value of `iVar8` to it. in the second `if` condition it checks if `iVar3` & the `iVar8`(After assign the `getNthValueSafe()` to it) values are not equal to `-1` then it will create unknown `JSON` string and assign it to `uVar4`, Finally it will add an item to object to `uVar2` which created before and it's the `JSON` data then `auStack_1318` which is the key and `uVar4` which is the value. Let's move forward with the rest of lines:

```
__s1 = (char *)websGetVar(uVar2,"username","admin");
pcVar6 = (char *)websGetVar(uVar2,"password","");
__src = (char *)websGetVar(uVar2,"http_host","");
__nptr = (char *)websGetVar(uVar2,&DAT_0001dd80,"");
apmib_get(0xb6,&local_1198);
apmib_get(0xb7,&local_1174);
apmib_get(0xc0,&local_17a0);
```

Here we can see the following assigned variables which store values retrived by `websGetVar()` function let's go step by step:

- **\_\_s1**: storing the value retrieved with `username` from the http request and the `admin` value will be used if the requested variable is not found.
    
- **pcVar6**: storing the value retrieved with `password` from the http request and the `""` value will be used if the requested variable is not found.
    
- **\_\_src**: storing the value retrieved with `http_host` from the http request and the `""` value will be used if the requested variable is not found.
    
- **\_\_nptr**: storing the value referenced by the memory address `&DAT_0001dd80` from the http request and the `""` value will be used if the requested variable is not found.
    

Note: let's rename each variable that stores a value so we can make the code more clearly.  
Finally, each call for the `apmib_get()` function is for retrieving a value from a data structure and storing it in a local variable `local_x` for later use. So, we can complete with the rest of the code:

![](/assets/images/0d59c62a9ae4bb191888b2b5255f9a7a)

&nbsp;

After renaming the variables, We can see it's became more clearly now. IN the lines after the previous lines, There is an `IF` condition which checks if the first character of `Host` is null character or no, If that true it will call a function named `getLanIp()` and from it's name we can guess it's getting the IP address for the device `NIC` so the `acStack_1150` variable is the device interface. So, let's rename it and after we rename it. Everything is clear it checks for the `Hostname or IP`. Finally, if it's not then it will copy the `Host` value to the `deviceInterface` which also could be a host-name.

![](/assets/images/d7af7345820f95322cff9e281ce15be0)

By checking the next line, It also another condition to check the `username` and password:

![](/assets/images/eed944780534881324ecba4cca762538)

It checks if the `userName` or `passWord` is null character or no, If yes, then it will set the `loginflag` to `1` which maybe indicates that the login is failed. and if this doesn't happen it comparing the `userName` with `local_1198` and store the results to `iVar5` and for the `local_1198` then if the results not equal to `0` that means it fails and will set the `loginflag` to `1`, if we go to the previous line we can see that this variable in the following line `apmib_get(0xb6,&local_1198);` and we remember that the `apmlib_get()` function is for retrieving a value from a data structure and storing it in a local variable and by doing some search the value is from the configuration. So, we can guess that this variable carry the device username so let's rename it. And moving to the next lines:

![](/assets/images/a6db966fcfa7c428837f84c5b24883df)

As we can see there is `passwordTrans()` function which takes 2 parameters the `passWord` parameter and another parameter which is `acStack_50`. By clicking on the `passwordTrans()` function we can see the following code:

```
void passwordTrans(int param_1,char *param_2)

{
  char cVar1;
  int iVar2;
  int iVar3;
  int iVar4;
  char *pcVar5;
  
  iVar4 = 1;
  iVar3 = 0;
  pcVar5 = param_2;
  while( true ) {
    cVar1 = *(char *)(param_1 + iVar3);
    if (cVar1 == '\0') break;
    if (cVar1 == '%') {
      iVar2 = hextochar(*(char *)(param_1 + iVar3 + 1),*(char *)(param_1 + iVar3 + 2));
      *pcVar5 = (char)iVar2;
      iVar3 = iVar3 + 3;
    }
    else {
      *pcVar5 = cVar1;
      iVar3 = iVar3 + 1;
    }
    iVar4 = iVar4 + 1;
    pcVar5 = pcVar5 + 1;
  }
  param_2[iVar4 + -1] = '\0';
  return;
}
```

Basically, the `passwordTrans()` function appears to take a encoded password string and returns the decoded password string by replacing any percent encoded characters with their `ASCII` equivalent characters by iterating through each character in the password string, checking if the character is a percent sign and converting the two `hexadecimal` characters following the percent sign to their `ASCII` equivalent, Then it saves it in the second passed parameter which in this case is `acStack_50`. So, We can guess that this is the final password, Let's rename it to `finalPassword`. By going back to our `loginAuth()` function. After the `passwordTrans()` function call we can see the following:

![](/assets/images/cc887279e8c5901ef14051bb7a99bb93)

Here it compares the `finalPassword` with a variable loaded using `memset()` function and we can guess it's the configured password (so we will rename it to `devicePassword`), and it's assign the result into the `iVar5` & After that it checks if the `iVar5` is not equal to `0` which indicates that the login is not successful and set the `loginflag` to `1`. After that coming the next lines

![](/assets/images/6c6878d672bd778489da9277b13f588c)

It comparing the `userName` provided by the user with the one in the device which is `deviceUserName` and storing the results, then it checks if `iVar5` is equal to `0` and do another compare between `finalPassword` and `devicePassword` and save the results also in `iVar5`. If the condition is true then it will set the `loginflag` to `0`, As a results the login is successful. After that it uses the `apmib_get()` function to get some configuration. And now by looking into the next lines:

![](/assets/images/9a695a447df24dafaaf4a243aa4f03f4)

In these lines it's all about conditions that will be executed, If the previous condition is true. By taking a look we can see it checks if the `local_17a0` is equal to `0` which we don't know yet. Then it create the `iVar5` stores the value of `__nptr` which converted by `atoi()` function which converts a string of characters representing an integer value into an actual integer value. Then it checks if `iVar5` to `1` and then assign some values to the `local_x` variables in this point if we take a look at the disassembled code we can notice the following:

![](/assets/images/0a9c4ebed4c57e9f7c8d7168613181d5)

And now it's obvious that it loads a word and it's is `mobie/home.asp` which is a mobile user endpoint, Now we can say that the `__nptr` is used to check if the user is on Desktop or Mobile, So let's rename it as `mobileUser` and rename the `local_x` variables and it's values. So we can say the code will be as the following:

```
iVar5 = atoi(mobileUser);
if (iVar5 == 1) {
    endPoint = "mobile/home.asp";
}
```

If this condition didn't achieved then it will check for the Desktop User as we can see also in the disassembled code has the `home.asp` without mobile:

![](/assets/images/9de036a2b5076aa9712b7ca1372861ab)

And after that if the user desktop or mobile is not identified it will be `wizard.asp` endpoint as we can see:

![](/assets/images/27aa47c23253ed600c1dbd8ff1eaac40)

So, the full clear code as the following:

```
if (local_17a0 == 0) {
  iVar5 = atoi(mobileUser);
  if (iVar5 == 1) {
        endPoint = "mobile/home.asp";
  }
  else if (desktopUser == 1) {
        endPoint = "home.asp";
  }
  else {
        endPoint = "wizard.asp";
  }
```

Now, if the first condition which is `if (local_17a0 == 0) {` not true then it will jump to the following:

![](/assets/images/45453627725187f052cf14523273ab6e)

Which also check if the User is on mobile or desktop, Then back to the condition that check the credentials which is `if ((iVar5 == 0) && (iVar5 = strcmp(finalPassword,(char *)&devicePassword), iVar5 == 0)` if it's not true it will check if the user is on mobile or no and assign the `mobile/login.asp` endpoint which the user will redirect to it:

![](/assets/images/1cb414c7e9f66678b985a7bb54648014)

So, the clear code for this is as the following:

```
if (local_17a0 == 0) {
  iVar5 = atoi(mobileUser);
  if (iVar5 == 1) {
        endPoint = "mobile/home.asp";
  }
  else if (desktopUser == 1) {
        endPoint = "home.asp";
  }
  else {
        endPoint = "wizard.asp";
  }
else {
iVar5 = atoi(mobileUser);
    if (iVar5 == 1) {
  endPoint = "mobile/login.asp";
  iVar5 = 0;
}
    else {
  endPoint = "login.asp";
  iVar5 = 0;
}
}
```

From the clear code we can guess that `local_17a0` is checks for the authentication or the login. So, we will rename it to `isAuth`. Now, we getting closer to the place of the bug as we see:

```
snprintf(acStack_1050,0x1000,"{\"httpStatus\":\"%s\",\"host\":\"%s\"","302",deviceInterface);
```

Here, It assigns the status of request to the `acSTack_1050` we can rename it to `reqResponse`, In this case it will redirect the user to the login page as authentication failed, Then it will assign the length of the `reqResonse` to `sVar6 = strlen(reqResponse);` to prevent `overflow` attacks. Now, coming here we gonna see it does a check again on the user to see if it's on Desktop or mobile and here what the developer missed it out:

![](/assets/images/0c6170dc1432a2d9072363654d6c5229)

Out of the first checks this code assign the following to the response if the user is on mobile:

```
snprintf(reqResponse + sVar6,0x1000 - sVar6,
         ",\"redirectURL\":\"http://%s/formLoginAuth.htm?authCode=%d&userName=%s&password=%s&goU RL=%s&action=login&flag=1\"}"
         ,deviceInterface,iVar5,userName,finalPassword,(char *)&local_1798);
```

The values of the parameters as the following the first `%s` is for the `deviceInterface` then the second one is `%d` which is for `iVar5` and if we back to the code where the login check failed it assigned `0` to the `iVar5`, So we can say that the `iVar5` here in this case is for `authCode` and it's equal `0` and here it comes the issue as the `authCode` value can be passed by the user through a request it can be manipulate all of these parameters. By the way, If it's not mobile user it will do the same response, But without the `flag=1` which indicates that user is mobile. Now, let's take this response URL and manipulate it:

```
mydevice/formLoginAuth.htm?authCode=1&userName=admin&password=Idontneedit&goURL=home.asp&action=login
```

If we try it we will be able to see that we bypassed all these checks as the mistakes done by the developer to assign the redirect and response out of the checks.

# **Final Thoughts**

The developer created a big mistake in 2 things first sending the response out and after of the checks & relay on `authCode` parameter results and it can be manipulated by the user. The developer shall assign the `authCod` hardcoded and not editable by the user. But, the best solution is to relay on the username and password as any authentication process which happens in the code and not send them back to the response. The secure code can be as the following:

```
// If authentication success
if (isAuth == 0) {
          // create sessin for user
      snprintf(Session, Session_Length, "Set-Cookie: session_id=%s; Path=/\n", session_id);
  iVar5 = atoi(mobileUser);
    // If user on mobile
  if (iVar5 == 1) {
      // assign mobile endpoint
        endPoint = "mobile/home.asp";
      
      // set user authentication to successful
        snprintf(reqResponse + sVar6,0x1000 - sVar6,
         ",\"redirectURL\":\"http://%s/formLoginAuth.htm?goURL=%s&action=login&flag=1\"}"
         ,deviceInterface,(char *)&endPoint);
      // send the response to user and exit
        websGetCfgResponse(param_1,param_3,reqResponse, Session);
        exit(0);
  }
    // if it's a desktop user
  else if (desktopUser == 1) {
      // assign desktop endpoint
        endPoint = "home.asp";
      // set user authentication to successful
        snprintf(reqResponse + sVar6,0x1000 - sVar6,
         ",\"redirectURL\":\"http://%s/formLoginAuth.htm?goURL=%s&action=login\"}"
         ,deviceInterface,(char *)&endPoint);
      // send the response to user and exit
        websGetCfgResponse(param_1,param_3,reqResponse, Session);
        exit(0);
  }
    // if it's not known mobile or desktop
  else {
      // assign wizard.asp endpoint
        endPoint = "wizard.asp";
      // set user authentication to successful
        snprintf(reqResponse + sVar6,0x1000 - sVar6,
         ",\"redirectURL\":\"http://%s/formLoginAuth.htm?goURL=%s&action=login\"}"
         ,deviceInterface,userName,finalPassword,(char *)&endPoint);
       // send the response to user and exit
        websGetCfgResponse(param_1,param_3,reqResponse, Session);
        exit(0);
  }

// If authentication not success
else {
iVar5 = atoi(mobileUser);
    // If user on mobile
  if (iVar5 == 1) {
      // assign mobile endpoint
  endPoint = "mobile/login.asp";
  // send the response to user and exit
      snprintf(reqResponse,0x1000,"{\"httpStatus\":\"%s\",\"host\":\"%s\"","302",deviceInterface, endPoint);
        websGetCfgResponse(param_1,param_3,reqResponse, Session);
        exit(0);
}
    // if it's a desktop user or else
  else {
      // assign desktop endpoint
  endPoint = "login.asp";
        // send the response to user and exit
      snprintf(reqResponse,0x1000,"{\"httpStatus\":\"%s\",\"host\":\"%s\"","302",deviceInterface, endPoint);
      websGetCfgResponse(param_1,param_3,reqResponse, Session);
      exit(0);
}
}
```

In this code the developer will not relay on the `authCode` and after any condition came true it will send the response to the user and exit immediately, Which leaves no chance for the user to do anything.

# **Conclusion**

In this analysis we saw the root cause of the issue and how it can be solved in an example code, Also how we can analysis the unclear decompiled code to understand as much as we can of the code and make it clear.Finally, You have to keep each code under it's condition.
