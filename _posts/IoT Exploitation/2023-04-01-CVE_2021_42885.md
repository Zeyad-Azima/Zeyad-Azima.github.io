# **Introduction**

A vulnerability discovered in TOTOLINK `EX1200T` model known as `CVE-2021-42885` which is a remote command injection through the `deviceMac` parameter, As a results a malicious user can control the device and achieve remote command execution RCE. (`Note:Everything you obtain here is for educational purposes, Don't use or abuse any bug against any target without permissions`)

# **Obtaining the Firmware**

Before we start we would need the firmware of the device, therefore We can take a static look at the code and how it works to understand more. So, what we need is the vulnerable Firmware for the device which is `V4.1.2cu.5215` and we have many ways to do it:

- You can search for the firmware on the official website for the vendor.
    
- Download it from any other source (after someone already dump it from the device and published it).
    
- Dump the firmware through `UART`, You could read a detailed blog from [Here](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/accessing-and-dumping-firmware-through-uart).
    
- Also, you could contact the support to provide you with the firmware.
    
- Finally dumping the firmware using `CH341A` Mini programmer USB, You could read a detailed blog from [Here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/dumping-firmware-with-the-ch341a-programmer/).
    

In my case, I found the firmware on the vendor website. Now, Let's extract the firmware using `binwalk` tool as the following `binwalk -e --run-as=root "TOTOLINK_C8180E-1C_EX1200T_WX022_8197F_SPI_8M64M_V4.1.2cu.5215_B20210330_ALL.web"` and here is the output:

```
$ ls
TOTOLINK_C8180E-1C_EX1200T_WX022_8197F_SPI_8M64M_V4.1.2cu.5215_B20210330_ALL.web
$ sudo binwalk -e --run-as=root "TOTOLINK_C8180E-1C_EX1200T_WX022_8197F_SPI_8M64M_V4.1.2cu.5215_B20210330_ALL.web"

And as i am using `Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)`, Here we can browser our firmware normally:

# **The Analysis**

It's the time for the analysis.the request made that contains `deviceMac` parameter where the command get injected is as the following:

```
POST /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1

Content-Length: 68

{"topicurl":"setting/setDeviceName",
"deviceMac":"Vulnerable",
"deviceName":"1"}
```

Let's go with `Ghidra` and reverse the `cstecgi.cgi` file. Now, By going to the file and check it with the `file` command, We can see it's an `ELF 32bit MIPS` file:

![](/assets/images/2542c29bcd004ce267f828f89be9010f)

Open it and create a new project i named it `EX1200T` for the device name and drop the `cstecgi.cgi` file into the project:

![](/assets/images/5662f4608bd3a068ee127a103094d625)

After that open the file using `Code Browser` within `Ghidra`:

![](/assets/images/73ea583ba2aa3a1235d1365066806104)

Then, analysis the file:

![](/assets/images/ad68c12d850bd55aae344e7224438abd)

Navigating to `Symbol Tree` and let's check out the functions:

![](/assets/images/130d2a5d9acab5412b6e6d51c1378a9c)

After going through the functions clearly inside `FUN_00400dd8` function we can see the following lines of codes. But, there is no thing interesting and it's all about functions calling other functions:

![](/assets/images/0db44be11c8099d07fd2ddeb527620e2)

We just can see that `httpStatus`, `redirectURL` & `responseParam` being passed to some unclear functions. But, You can see under `\squashfs-root\lib\cste_modules` folder that there are libraries named as the following:

```
app.so
cloudupdate.so
global.so
lan.so
product.so
system.so
upgrade.so
wireless.so
wps.so
```

After reversing this libraries you will know that it's clearly used by the `cstecgi.cgi` to perform different operations and changes through the device panel. Let's identify which one contains the `deviceMac` by searching through the following `Bash` one liner using `strings` command:

```
for i in $(ls -la | awk '{print $9}' | grep ".so"); do echo ""; echo "Lib Name: $i"; strings $i | grep "deviceMac"; done
```

The above line will print the library name after this will run the `strings` command on the library to get any string has the word `deviceMac` and will print the results under the library name. Therefore, we will be able to know which library could has the vulnerable code or anything related. Command output:

```
Lib Name: app.so

Lib Name: cloudupdate.so

Lib Name: global.so
,{"deviceMac":"%s","deviceName":"%s"}
deviceMac

Lib Name: lan.so

Lib Name: product.so

Lib Name: system.so

Lib Name: upgrade.so

Lib Name: wireless.so

Lib Name: wps.so
```

And as we can see it's with-in the `global.so` library, As we did with the `cstecgi.cgi` file. Let's do the same with the library with `Ghidra`. After opening the `Functions` tab under `Symbol Tree` we can notice the `setDeviceName` function:

![](/assets/images/49ea426def3e66f891b22a660de1ae32)

So, We can say the flaw is as the following:

![](/assets/images/18499c03e0a15898ec3426aa22d937ed)

Now, Let's understand what this function do and how it works. First the function start by taking 3 parameters:

```
undefined4 setDeviceName(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2,undefined4 param_3)
```

After that the following lines declaring variables:

![](/assets/images/baf28087164b901090c5db57391d8b4c)

- `char cVar1`: This declares a variable `cVar1` of type char.
    
- `bool bVar2`: This declares a variable `bVar2` of type bool.
    
- `char *pcVar3`: This declares a variable `pcVar3` of type `char *`, which is a pointer to a character.
    
- `char *pcVar4`: This declares a variable pcVar4 of type `char *`, which is also a pointer to a character.
    
- `int iVar5`: This declares a variable `iVar5` of type integer.
    
- `FILE *__stream`: This declares a variable `__stream` of type `FILE *`, which is a pointer to a FILE type used for input/output operations.
    
- `size_t sVar6`: This declares a variable `sVar6` of type size\_t, which is an unsigned integer type. It's commonly used to represent sizes of objects.
    
- `char *pcVar7`: This declares a variable `pcVar7` of type `char *`, which is another pointer to a character.
    
- `char *__s`: This declares a variable `__s` of type `char *`, which is a pointer to a character.
    
- `char acStack_1138 [127]`: This declares an array `acStack_1138` of 127 characters. This array is allocated on the stack.
    
- `char acStack_10b9 [129]`: This declares another array `acStack_10b9` of 129 characters. This array is also allocated on the stack.
    
- `char local_1038 [32]`: This declares an array `local_1038` of 32 characters. This array is also allocated on the stack.
    
- `char local_1018 [4064]`: This declares an array `local_1018` of 4064 characters. This array is also allocated on the stack.
    
- char `*local_38`: This declares a variable `local_38` of type `char *`, which is yet another pointer to a character.
    
- `char *local_34`: This declares a variable `local_34` of type `char *`, which is also a pointer to a character.
    
- `char *local_30`: This declares a variable `local_30` of type `char *`, which is also a pointer to a character.
    

Then, When it comes to line `22` we can see the following calls for functions:

![](/assets/images/f827d1f18a0fa1b0e940e9da10d517c7)

The `memset()` function is used to initialize arrays to a specific value for the `acStack_1138` array with zeros and has a size of `0x80` (`128 bytes`) & `acStack_10b9` array, starting from the second element `acStack_10b9 + 1` with zeros and has a size of `0x80` (`128 bytes`). Then, initializes the `local_1038` array with zeros and has a size of `0x1000` (`4096 bytes`). Finally, retrieves a value of the parameter `deviceMac` from the web request and stores it in `pcVar3` and retrieves a value of the parameter `deviceName` from the web request and stores it in `pcVar4`. So, Let's rename the `pcVar3` to `deviceMac` & pcVar4 to `deviceName`. At the end executes a shell command using the `system()` function and the command being executed is `/bin/jffs2.sh 1 2> /dev/null`, Let's connect to the router and check the file and what is it do. I connected the device through `telnet` services:

![](/assets/images/e98a28584d7d1233a47b1f056bcf3f7a)

And as we can see here is the file:

![](/assets/images/13e07c0674a4a1782e5b33d642a99e36)

When we `cat` the file we can get it's content as the following:

```
#!/bin/sh
#
# script file to mount userdata.jffs2
#
# Usage: jffs2.sh {mtdname}
#

umount /dev/mtdblock2 2>/dev/null

sleep 1

if [ $1 -eq 1 ]; then
        mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock2 /mnt -o rw 2>/dev/null
else
        mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock2 /mnt -o ro 2>/dev/null
fi

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then

        if [ $1 -eq 1 ]; then
                mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock2 /mnt -o rw 2>/dev/null
        else
                mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock2 /mnt -o ro 2>/dev/null
        fi

        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
                if [ $1 -eq 1 ]; then
                        mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock2 /mnt -o rw 2>/dev/null
                else
                        mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock2 /mnt -o ro 2>/dev/null
                fi

                if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
                        echo "mount invalid! erase mtd and mount again!"
                        sysconf mtd_erase
                fi
        fi
fi
```

The script attempts to unmount any existing file system on `/dev/mtdblock2`. Any error messages produced by the command are discarded and waits for 1 second.After that checks the value of the argument `$1`. If it is equal to 1, the file system is mounted as `read-write` (`-o rw` option). Otherwise, it is mounted as read-only (`-o ro` option), Then checks the exit status of the previous command. If it is not equal to `0`, the mount operation failed. If the mount operation failed, the script attempts to mount the file system again, up to three times. If the mount operation still fails after three attempts, the script outputs an error message and runs the command `sysconf mtd_erase` which erase the memory technology device (`mtd`) and mount the file system again. By moving on with the following lines:

![](/assets/images/d425ba3f3633beaf06d7ae3c41c59ae9)

the code checks for the existence of a file `/mnt/customDeviceName`, opens it, reads its contents, and performs some operations on the data. if the file `/mnt/customDeviceName` exists and is readable. If it does, `access()` returns `0`, and `iVar5` is set to `0`. and if we go to the device again we can see that the file contains the data we send in the request:

![](/assets/images/55791fdcc3e175f18a53456a1b812dbd)

After that checks if `access()` succeeded in finding the file. If the file exists,It opens the file for reading and if the file was successfully opened, a loop that reads lines from the file using `fgets()` and stores it in the buffer `__s`, Then performs some operations on the data until there are no more lines to read.After that `strlen(__s)` determines the length of the string read by `fgets()` and `acStack_10b9[sVar6]` sets the null terminator at the end of the string in the `acStack_10b9`. Then, checks if the second character in `acStack_10b9` is not null and if the string contains a `,`. If both conditions are met, the code extracts two strings from the line using `strncpy()` and `strstr()` & as we can guess it's the `deviceMac`,`deviceName` and formats them using `snprintf()`. Finally, stores them in the `local_1038` array. If no matching string is found, the code formats the two variables `deviceMac` and `deviceName` using `snprintf()` and stores them in `local_1038`. Finally, the file is closed using `fclose()`.

![](/assets/images/36ad6cad8708a6b539a578445bdbec9e)

If `access()` doesn't succeeded in finding the file creates a string containing a command that writes the values of `deviceMac` and `deviceName` to the file `/mnt/customDeviceName` and then execute the `command system(acStack_1138)`. After that checks if the `local_1038` array contains any data a loop that writes data to the file `/mnt/customDeviceName` using by executing command. The loop continues until the end of the `local_1018` array is reached and then If `iVar3` is `0`, the loop writes the first value of `local_1038` to the file using the `>` redirection operator. Otherwise, it appends the value to the file using the `>>` redirection operator. So, as we can see clearly there is no input validation is done on the `deviceMac` & `deviceName` which can be manpulated by the user. Now, It's time for exploiting it. Opening `Burp Suite` and take the request to the repeater tab and start to reproduce the bug.

![](/assets/images/6c13f226bdb1a846f2bb8ac00d016b1f)

After we send the request we can see that the `poc` file created under `/tmp` directory if we open our device through `telnet` services again we can find the file:

![](/assets/images/699bda9e8442c73e91584850d6af38ad)

# **Final Thoughts**

The developer shall use an `Asp` endpoint to operate the save of the `deviceMac` on the device as a different option instead of executing commands to do it. But, In our case of this code there are many solutions to make sure it will be hard for the user to escape the default command and inject malicious command using `regex` to check for a valid `MAC` address as the following:

```
char *regex_pattern = "^([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}[:-]){5}([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})$";

    // Compile the regex pattern
    regex_t regex;
    int reti = regcomp(&regex, regex_pattern, REG_EXTENDED);
    if (reti != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to compile regex\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Execute the regex match
    reti = regexec(&regex, deviceMac, 0, NULL, 0);
    if (reti == 0) {
          system("/bin/jffs2.sh 1 2> /dev/null");
  iVar3 = access("/mnt/customDeviceName",0);
  if (iVar3 == 0) {
    __stream = fopen("/mnt/customDeviceName","r");
    if (__stream != (FILE *)0x0) {
      local_38 = local_1038;
      bVar2 = false;
      iVar3 = 0;
      __s = acStack_10b9 + 1;
      local_34 = "%s,%s";
      while (pcVar5 = fgets(__s,0x80,__stream), pcVar5 != (char *)0x0) {
        sVar4 = strlen(__s);
        acStack_10b9[sVar4] = '\0';
        if ((acStack_10b9[1] != '\0') && (pcVar5 = strchr(__s,0x2c), pcVar5 != (char *)0x0)) {
          local_30 = local_38;
          strncpy(local_38,__s,0x20);
          pcVar5 = strstr(local_38,deviceMac);
          if (pcVar5 != (char *)0x0) {
            snprintf(local_30,0x20,local_34,deviceMac,deviceName);
            bVar2 = true;
          }
          iVar3 = iVar3 + 1;
          local_38 = local_38 + 0x20;
        }
      }
      if (!bVar2) {
        snprintf(local_1038 + iVar3 * 0x20,0x20,"%s,%s",deviceMac,deviceName);
      }
      fclose(__stream);
    }
  }
  else {
    sprintf(acStack_1138,"echo \'%s,%s\' > /mnt/customDeviceName",deviceMac,deviceName);
    system(acStack_1138);
  }
  if (local_1038[0] != '\0') {
    iVar3 = 0;
    deviceMac = local_1038;
    deviceName = local_1018;
    do {
      if (iVar3 == 0) {
        sprintf(acStack_1138,"echo \'%s\' > /mnt/customDeviceName",deviceMac);
      }
      else {
        sprintf(acStack_1138,"echo \'%s\' >> /mnt/customDeviceName",deviceMac);
      }
      system(acStack_1138);
      iVar3 = iVar3 + 1;
      cVar1 = *deviceName;
      deviceMac = deviceName;
      deviceName = deviceName + 0x20;
    } while (cVar1 != '\0');
  }
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
```

Here we used `regex` to check the patterns of the `deviceMac` if it's valid or no, If it's not valid it will exit without executing anything. But, If it's valid then it will execute the code normally.

# **Conclusion**

In this analysis we had a look on `CVE-2021-42885` and highlighted the issue made by the developer & Provided a solution that can help in mitigating the issue. Finally, You could use any other decompilers other than `Ghidra` as it's not making the codes more clear.
